{"id": 3, "text": "If you are a member of Congress, you should not be in this situation at all. You were elected to represent your constituents because your values and your commitment to social justice have helped to keep a critical portion of America together against a president who is not only unqualified but actively hostile to it. You are not representative of the Republican Party, although you claim otherwise. You were elected to represent a diverse body of Americans. Your constituents believe that you represent them. They trust you. They are not going to trust your government. In the months and years ahead, they will insist that you stand up to President Trump, even if his actions in office have proven otherwise. But that will take courage on their part. For now, you have to choose. The choice you face is clear. You must choose one party over the other. To be clear, neither of them offer you any reason to be afraid.\"\n\nI'm not sure whether this is the official position of the Democratic Party, but they're right when they claim that Trump's election would have been an abject catastrophe for the Democratic Party because he has \"shown that he is unqualified and unfriendly toward women.\" And while they're correct that they don't seem to understand that in a democratic republic like ours, candidates and government employees are elected by elections and not by popularity contests with voters, which is why the electoral college actually does a pretty good job of electing presidents.\n\nWhat they should be saying, instead, is that Trump's election was a disaster for their party. Why? Because the Democratic Party has failed to appeal to white Americans, the voters that Trump won. The party's presidential candidates failed to make common cause with white conservatives, and its presidential nominee refused to do that either. The party's presidential nominee did not reach out to women or minorities or immigrants or people of color. He did not appeal to the common ground they need. Trump, in other words, is not \"unqualified.\" He is a dangerous idiot, and the Democrats need to distance themselves from him in order to be more appealing to Republicans.\n\nTrump's victory in November has brought with it a sense that the Democrats, and the Democratic Party in particular, have failed its core voters. While some of Trump's supporters may believe that this was simply because they felt cheated by the system and won't accept the results, there's a good deal more to it than that. One of the first things you realize when you vote for an unpopular president is that the system has screwed you. The electoral college gave him the victory. The Democrats, by contrast, managed to do a reasonably decent job of turning out their electoral base. So, for better or worse, they weren't completely at fault.\n\nSo, in my opinion, the Democrats' failure to appeal to white Americans was a mistake, whether they realize it or not. In particular, it was a mistake on three levels. First, that the Democrats thought that by catering to white voters they were, somehow, going to change the fundamental equation of our nation—the United States as a nation for people of color, not white people. They just don't get it.\n\nSecondly, they thought that white American racists wanted an alternative to Trump. The fact is there's not that many racist white people in America. In 2016, the American average is 4.7 racists per 10,000 people. That's the least racist country in the world. The problem of racism doesn't have to be limited to white people in this country. Racism exists among any segment of the population. By catering to white voters, the Democratic Party undermined its most important constituency.\n\nLastly, the Democrats realized that their appeal was limited to those white voters, so they didn't try to appeal to other groups of whites in this country, like Latinos and African Americans, as well. When Latinos and African Americans vote for Democrats, they do so in droves, showing that even Democrats don't live in monoliths any more.\n\nSo, to summarize: the Democratic Party's 2016 election strategy was to appeal to white voters to become Democrats. As a result, Trump won the national popular vote more than 4 million more times than Clinton. But the party didn't come anywhere close to winning white voters. This is part of the reason that Clinton lost the election, a reason that I've written about here and here.\n\nAs the Democrats' new slogan proclaims, what's the best way to fight back against a president who is a bigot, a liar, a misogynist, and an Islamophobe? By appealing to white voters. And they've done a pretty decent job of it so far.\n\nBut in a democracy, that doesn't necessarily mean that the Democratic Party must win over people who support or are affiliated with white nationalists. But that doesn't mean that the Democratic Party can't fight for those who are non-white. That won't hurt the Democrats in any meaningful way, and for their part, the Republicans must not adopt a racially ambiguous \"", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

But it needed to gain 50% support to pass in the Senate.\n\nThe proposal also would allow the House Speaker to remove a member of the House with a unanimous vote and the Speaker could only remove a Republican member.\n\nAccording to Democratic Party spokeswoman Lauren Passalacqua, \"We have a long history of working with and supporting Democrats in our campaigns.

It is not required that the candidate receiving the most votes in each district wins the primary.\n\nThe proposal would not require that a voter be a member of any of the parties that wish to run, but would require a candidate seeking election to a House seat be a member of one of those four major political parties.\n\nThe amendment itself contains a number of provisions that were not included in the Democrats' original resolution, which was passed in 2007, but which have also been incorporated by Republicans.\n\nThe amendment includes language that would prohibit the House Speaker from removing a Republican from his or her position of leadership unless said election results in a tie between the Democratic and Republican candidates in the primary contest. It also mandates that the majority of the House seats be assigned to Republicans \"within the first 100 days of the first session after the date of the adoption of this article.\" The current House majority is 87 Democrats and 33 Republicans.\n\nIn addition, the amendment mandates that the House chair of each committee and the minority leader of each House chamber \"shall\" be either Republican, Democratic, or Libertarian.\n\nIn 2009, Republicans and Democrats held the House and Senate respectively.

{"id": 5, "text": "In December, the president's new defense secretary, James Mattis, testified before a Senate Armed Services Committee. He faced questions about a possible expansion of the war against the Islamic State with a limited air war and a new strategy focused on capturing the city of Raqqa in Syria. These two developments would represent a shift in how the United States attacks Syria and other adversaries. But they would also represent new opportunities for the Obama administration, which has struggled lately to establish a coherent narrative about ISIS. \"If you take Raqqa, Raqqa goes,\" Mattis said. \"If you take it, America's in deep trouble, and I don't think there's a lot of doubt about that.\"\n\nThe administration has previously said, without providing evidence, that it sees ISIS's fate largely in doubt. It also declined to say whether Mattis would approve or modify a proposed military strike on Syria and, in a related but separate matter, hinted that the administration would be willing to work with Russia and Iran to destroy the militants in Syria. The administration also has repeatedly asserted that U.S. troops would not be allowed on the ground in Iraq and Syria, leaving them largely in a supporting role.\n\nTo the extent that the United States does engage in direct combat against ISIS, many of its actions and strategies appear to reflect a failure to distinguish between the United States and Islamic State fighters. In its latest strategy, for example, the administration said it would launch airstrikes in Iraq against the group if the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a \"meaningful political accommodation\" with the militants. Yet the goal of that policy was to prevent Assad from controlling large chunks of Syria while letting him preserve the country's opposition and moderate groups that he relies on as a bulwark against Islamic State, whose presence the United States considers a major national security threat.\n\nIn a speech in Iraq last week, President Trump made clear that his approach does not entail a clear reduction of U.S. involvement in the country even if fighting continues throughout the country. \"If it's stopped, it's stopped. This is not over,\" Trump declared at one point while visiting a base in the western province of Anbar.", "length": 439, "ended": true}
{"id": 6, "text": "By Tom Hunter (@PuckDontLie)\n\nThe NHL is no longer a team sport. Now every night is a game and there is no off-season anymore. That means there is no place to get off the couch and have some fun on a night off, unless of course you happen to live in Seattle.\n\nSo on the final day of the 2017-18 season, the Seattle Reign have made history by winning their second NWSL championship. To celebrate, they made every player wearing the \"No. 1\" shirt one of the team's top stars.\n\nAccording to Megan Bell (of the Seattle Times Seattle Times blog) it went down like this:\n\n\"I was on the bench and the captain, Alex Morgan, stopped by to tell me and two other guys to get on the ice. I asked the one dude if she was OK. He looked at me like I asked him if he had AIDS. Then he turned her face to face with mine and she put her hand on my groin with a big smile. She asked \"are you OK? Are you OK?\"\n\n\"I was like, 'OK, I guess I'm OK right now'\" Bell remembered.\n\nMorgan got on the ice and Bell tried to talk to her. \"But she had her hand back on mine. She was, 'OK, I guess we're in for it.'\"\n\nMorgan had other ideas.\n\n\"I was trying to talk to her, but she put her hand on my leg and I was like, 'No, I need to go.' Then she ran through the tunnel and took off for the locker room. When she did I was laughing at her — that's when I noticed she had an I.D. on and it was 'no'. She just didn't want to be there.\"\n\nThat's right. Seattle Reign players in the Champions League playoffs. That's the kind of thing that would make even the most competitive player in a locker room laugh and smile.\n\nIn all fairness, Bell hasn't actually said what Morgan said to her, but that's what you get.\n\nSo if you've got an I.D. on, you're probably in the wrong room. And that's good.\n\nThe Reign are now in MLS by default, and if the NWSL wants a chance to bring back the NWSL, they have no choice but to start taking the club seriously in the eyes of Major League Soccer. For now, Seattle Reign will be in the middle of the pack. You could certainly look at the NWSL and say they're just a bunch of amateur league teams with no chance of success in MLS.\n\n\"We want to make sure that the NWSL feels like a real league. We do not want to be relegated back to the Division I level just because the MLS side doesn't have players that fit in, or that we don't think should play in the league.\"\n\nIt's certainly true that the league needs to get on board. While Seattle Reign were going through a horrible first half of the season to make it through the playoffs anyway, that doesn't automatically make them a top tier NWSL team. So far this season, they're on the other end of those standings. So don't laugh.\n\nStill, the fact that Seattle won their second NWSL title on the final day of the season is a fitting tribute to the great players that they have.

{"id": 7, "text": "A week after the Boston Marathon bombing, President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden called the tragedy a \"heinous crime.\" But a closer look reveals that the president and the vice president may be exaggerating their case. By a very wide margin, Americans believe that terrorism is a serious national security threat in 2011, with 44 percent believing it to be the greatest, compared to only 17 percent who think it is the least or not a threat at all, according to a March poll by the Public Religion Research Institute conducted among nearly 1,000 adults.\n\nIn fact, Americans' confidence in public safety has actually declined for the second consecutive month. That drop, and the fact that the president and vice president are emphasizing the same threat, may reflect Americans' growing impatience with the federal government's ability to prevent, protect, and even reverse tragedies. As the FBI investigates the possibility that the Tsarnaev brothers may have planned their alleged bombing together after the marathon bombings in April 2013, several Republicans have expressed concern that the White House is too hesitant to act. The Republican senator from Illinois, Mark Kirk, has said, according to The Washington Post, that he would not support funding for a new terror watch list in the next appropriations bill, \"due to the president's failure to keep Congress informed about a potential threat,\" suggesting he would rather not have to pass such legislation than see it signed into law. Kirk is one of a growing number of Republican-identified conservatives (mostly former members of the party caucus or former lawmakers) who have spoken out against a counterterrorism bill in the current Congress that would expand the powers of the government-assigned Terrorist Screening Center. Among the Republicans whose criticisms have attracted the most attention are Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican Senate hopeful who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, and Mike Lee, the Utah Republican Senate hopeful.\n\nIn response, the administration has been attempting to bolster public perception of its terrorism-focused response to the Tsarnaev brothers. In April, after Attorney General Eric Holder called the suspects \"suspects\" for the first time, the White House released an audio tape from an interview Holder gave to NPR's Terry Gross over the weekend, in which he acknowledged the intelligence community and said that \"people are not yet convinced\" that the brothers were part of a broader terrorist network. \"The question is how to put an end to it,\" Holder said.\n\nBut public confidence in the government's ability to prevent, protect, and reverse tragedies has plummeted, according to the poll. By two-to-one, Americans think the U.S. should do more to thwart and dismantle terrorist plots. And by a nearly two-to-one margin, they think that the president and others in his administration have failed to make their case for further federal interventions in the wake of the Boston bombings.\n\nA majority of Americans, 55 percent, believe the federal government has been too slow in intervening to prevent, protect, or reverse the Boston bombing in the 11 days since it took place. Only 27 percent believe it has done enough, while 26 percent think it has been too slow and 12 percent believe it has not done enough.\n\nThe Public Religion Research Institute poll was conducted online April 18 to 24 among a nationally representative sample of 1,016 adults. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj", "length": 690, "ended": true}

A few months ago, the country witnessed something very unusual: a dramatic change in how this region of Pakistan was ruled. Over the past week, two provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, have declared themselves independent from Pakistan.\n\nThe changes in the region come as the United States and its allies seek to contain the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in Pakistan. In response to terrorism that the Islamic State has unleashed, Pakistan launched a massive offensive against Taliban insurgents. And as a result, the militants are now on the decline. Last October, the Pakistani army declared victory in the fight against the militants. But not everyone believes that the success has been a one-time event. With the end of the Taliban in the region comes a wave of uncertainty.\n\nOn Wednesday, a week after the declaration of independence, four soldiers were killed while fighting against Taliban insurgents in the northwestern region of North Waziristan, the military said.\n\nIn Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the situation looks much different from that of the last few months. Over the weekend, a military unit of about 2,000 militants, armed with hand grenades and rocket launchers, attacked the provincial capital of Peshawar. The army announced on Tuesday, two military officers were killed in a drone strike inside the eastern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province's largest city.\n\n\"The Taliban in Khyber can be defeated by the military,\" Mohammad Sami, the director of the Punjab-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, told DW. \"A number of military operations could have been mounted to secure the region, which is quite strategically important. The Taliban are now fighting each other, so the situation has got much worse.\"\n\nIt's a bleak picture of what's to come. \"There is a lot of fear,\" says Mohammad Nizam, a Peshawar-based journalist, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \"The locals here are more nervous now than before the announcement, but they don't believe there will be any improvement. There was talk in the past week of the troops leaving because they were not needed and now the people are very worried about that.\"\n\nBut this is the situation in all three provinces. The Pakistani government seems to have decided that it is better to accept an uncertain future than to risk losing control of these provinces to the militants. \"It's the right thing to do,\" says Asad Ullah Khan, a Peshawar-based economist and a member of the All Pakistan Muslim League. \"The government needs stability.\"\n\nThe future of Punjab and Sindh\n\nIn Peshawar, the police chief has already decided to declare all three provinces as independent. The decision, he says, can be overturned by the federal or military leadership, but will remain in force until elections.\n\n\"The political decision to declare this as an independent province is not the wrong one, not the right one either,\" says Khan. But for the moment, it's been done; the announcement has already passed through the government. \"The government is going through the right procedures as per the constitution and the legislation,\" says Khan.\n\nBut there's a problem. The province of Sindh, the country's most populous province, is still very much a part of Pakistan. With the end of the Taliban and the military's control of Pakistan's most densely populated and economically important province, the new government there has not decided what to do with it.\n\nWhat can be done to ensure that this new chapter in Punjab province will stay the same\n\nThe people have not been consulted. There is no constitutional referendum to decide what happens next to the province. And, for now, the people in Punjab are not even allowed to vote either. All decisions are made in the capital city, Islamabad.\n\n'No one will take responsibility'\n\nThere are many other problems. The political leadership, according to Khan, has not even met the province's chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif. The chief minister met the government for the last time in early October and made statements of thanks and appreciation for the troops for helping the Pakistani state.\n\n\"That's not right. This is no time to be speaking about military and political leaders,\" asks Khan. \"How is that going to bring stability to Punjab? How is that going to help the people?\"\n\nThe situation is very different in Sindh, according to Abdul Quaid Khaliq, a writer and journalist who lived in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for decades.

{"id": 10, "text": "In August 2014, the Department of Defense conducted a series of aerial and ground surveillance flights over the city of Raqqa, Syria. During the air and ground sweeps, the DoD used a Boeing 767 aircraft, which has a range of over 3,500 miles, and a Lockheed Martin U2 aircraft. To capture the images, the DoD used a combination of aircraft and a large-scoped unmanned aerial vehicle that can take photos from high altitudes and at a great distance.\n\nIn some of the images, the aircraft was visible inside Raqqa in one or both of the following scenarios:\n\nAircraft flying a wide-range of surveillance missions over the city of Raqqa, Syria. These operations were conducted by the U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, which includes the Air Force Space Command, USAF, Navy, Coast Guard, Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Strategic Command. CENTCOM is responsible for U.S. military operations in Syria, Iraq, China, and Libya.\n\nThe aircraft in the photos are from the 6th and 19th Fighter Squadrons of the U.S. Air Force, based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The 517th Tactical Operations Group at Walker Air Force Base, Indiana, is responsible for air operations in Europe.\n\nThe U.S. Central Command's Air Force, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve or CJTF-OIR (pronounced \"Joint Task Force Inherent Resolve\") is an area of U.S., coalition, and partner operations in support of the United States of America. The CJTF-OIR consists of the U.S. Central Command headquarters at Air Force Osan Air Base in South Korea, U.S. European Command headquarters at Spangdahlem AB, Germany, U.S. Africa Command headquarters at Agadez Air Base and the U.S. Africa Command headquarters at Fort Benton in Missouri. As well as its headquarters, CJTF-OIR also maintains forward operating bases throughout the Middle East.\n\nThe United States uses surveillance aircraft to support the ground forces of the Syrian Democratic Forces -- made up of Kurdish and Arab forces, as well as several factions from Syria's main opposition forces. A large number of the aircraft have been dispatched during operations against ISIS in Iraq, but the majority have been deployed at various locations in Syria.\n\nIn addition to the aircraft flown by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the U.S. Central Command's F-22 Raptor and Joint Strike Fighter -- and other aircraft -- have also conducted reconnaissance flights near Raqqa over the past year. The aircraft typically fly within a few hundred feet of the ground and use sonar equipment to monitor ground targets. The U.S. Air Force is developing a small drone for use in Syria for this purpose (the name has yet to be selected) and is currently funding research on that aircraft.\n\nThe aircraft used in this particular air campaign (as well as other similar operations) include the following variants:\n\nThe Boeing 767\n\nThe U.S. Air Force U-2 or unmanned aerial vehicle\n\nThe F-22\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps F-35\n\nThese aircraft have been modified in various ways. Many have been fitted with cameras and software that use information from the sensor in the aircraft and/or sensors on the ground to obtain images of ground and ground-based targets. The images are then analyzed by software that will display them on the aircraft's screens (sometimes called \"dinner menus\"). The photos are then shared with other U.S. partners that are operating in the area.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department has reported that over the course of a year between January 2012 and September 2014, it carried out 12,931 combat sorties (operations) against targets in Syria and Iraq. It is worth noting, however, that the number of aircraft involved in these sorties is significantly smaller compared to the total number deployed. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the U.S. has not conducted multiple large scale, long-duration operations over Syria per year. According to John Kirby, the press secretary for the U.S. Central Command, the number of sorties carried out during the past year is comparable to missions carried out during the second half of the Iraq war.\n\nThe imagery from the aerial surveillance exercise also show that a number of other aircraft are involved. Most notably, it is believed there are also three RC-135s, which have their own missions of aerial reconnaissance, and two C-130 Hercules, which have their own airborne surveillance missions. The RC-135, or reconnaissance and target acquisition intelligence, in this case, involves sending a pair of high resolution video cameras (one each in the two helicopters) to a designated location and capturing high-resolution imagery before it is combined with other sources.\n\nDuring earlier operations, the U.S. conducted reconnaissance flights with manned and unmanned aircraft to gather intelligence on the movements", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

He had just scored his 25th points of the game and he put away the threat. The second he hit it, a player in the front row — a friend of Willliams's — threw his hands up in surrender, looking like he'd just won the lottery.\n\nWhen the clock ticked down, Willliams turned to his parents, whose reactions were, predictably, mostly disbelief. He sat there for several moments, trying to calm his parents down, but they just refused to let go. They knew why. Willliams could tell. He'd been watching, ever since he'd scored that first trey. The game had left his mind, and a few hours had passed. After the game, his stepfather, Brian, stood in the living room, looking at his son with a wry smile. \"Look at it, Dad,\" Willliams said. \"Why are you all smiles?\"\n\nBrian looked up and smiled, and then asked, \"But did you get mad at him?\"\n\nWillliams sat on the couch, and Brian went back to staring off into space. That afternoon, Willliams's stepfather told Brian that their home in the East Village of Brooklyn Heights had a security system that would alert him when Willliams entered the room.\n\n* * *\n\nThe day after the game, Willliams went back home to eat a meal with his two cousins and to spend some time with his stepfather. Brian walked him to the airport so he could fly from Detroit to Minnesota, and he asked Willliams at the airport if he wanted to see the Wolves. \"No,\" Willliams said.\n\nAfter boarding the plane, Willliams watched the Pistons blow a 14-point lead and let a seven-point deficit get into double digits. \"I knew how bad the game was going to get,\" he told me.\n\nIt was an understatement. The second half ended with six minutes left and it looked as though the Pistons would walk away from that game with the win. But Detroit's Kevin Martin pulled Detroit into overtime and Willliams scored 13 points in the extra period after Detroit's Brandon Jennings had cut the deficit to two points with 10:34 left. Even though Detroit ended up winning overtime, Willliams never got the chance to play his heart out because the Pistons lost in overtime by a score of 108-106.\n\n\"You were just standing there like a zombie,\" Frank Vogel told me as he walked the floor in the second overtime, in the Pistons' meeting room at the United Center. In the locker room afterward, the Pistons beat the Hornets in a game that went into double overtime. It was an emotional game. Vogel told me about watching the game on tape. He didn't have to watch it in person. He knew that he would feel the same way after he watched the game in the locker room, though he never knew how much that feeling would make him feel.\n\n* * *\n\nOn the road in Detroit on a Monday, Willliams ran along the sidewalk near Comerica Park. He had to run about half as fast he did in Brooklyn, but it felt more meaningful. There weren't many cameras on the field for the game, but his eyes followed the action. He looked around at his hometown. It was quiet but for one person, the guy he knew just about as well as anyone he played with for the Knicks, Anthony. The camera crew asked him for autographs. He held one out to his cousin Jaylen, who was playing for Detroit. \"Hey, Jaylen!\" Jaylen ran over to shake his hand, then pulled back his arm, surprised to not find it was tattooed with the number 1.\n\nWillliams was so excited about his hometown, so filled with energy, that he didn't know that he was a few feet away from the worst team at center for the Pistons in the playoffs in a decade. After a couple passes through the park, he got to his apartment and went straight to bed. He didn't know, though, that it was going to be the worst night of his life.\n\n* * *\n\nThe first day of the Pistons' summer league in Las Vegas, the team held a dinner to introduce the new players to the fans. A couple of guys walked up and took the microphone. Willliams walked up and politely declined. \"It's me,\" he said. He turned and walked off the stage. \"What the hell do you want me to do,\" he said. \"I'm already here!\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe following Monday, Willliams went to", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 15, "text": "The latest evidence for the value of the digital currency Bitcoin has its basis in an obscure, but widely cited, paper by an Australian academic named Prof. Peter Smith, a member of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of New South Wales. This particular paper, and it's accompanying video, was published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.\n\nSmith was among a group of researchers that participated in a joint conference organized by the European Commission in December of 2011. During the conference, Peter Smith explained to the audience where he got the idea for Bitcoin. As he described his research, he showed his audience a graph that revealed the value of a Bitcoin transaction. He then showed his slide deck on the history of Bitcoin value fluctuations. He proceeded to show that the graph that started in 1994 (with a total value of $100 each) had been fluctuating around $100 for the last 16 years (with a total value of $1,500). His argument for this fluctuation, he explained, was that the value of Bitcoin was rising in a cyclical fashion that reflected the market psychology of Bitcoin users, a market psychology that is in fact very complex and can differ tremendously from day to day (for example, a \"buy it now\" Bitcoin user may also be \"buy it once\" and may hold onto their Bitcoins for a year) and is subject to an endless cycle of volatility as determined by the monetary theory developed by Milton Friedman in his book Capitalism and Freedom.\n\nTo illustrate in a simple way how the value of a Bitcoin transaction can change, let's look at a couple of Bitcoin transactions. Let's say John, in this simple example, wants to purchase a pizza at a Pizza Hut. He signs up with a Google address, gives them his name, and sends his credit card number and address. He also gives them his email address so that he can communicate with them via email if needed.\n\nHere is a table (from Smith's lecture) of what has happened to the value of each Bitcoin transaction in recent years, relative to its value (in U.S. dollars) at the beginning of that transaction.\n\nIn 2009, John sends $100 in Bitcoin to Bitcoin address jsmith@academic.nyu.edu. As mentioned earlier, it is at the time that John signed up with Google, that Google started paying dividends to John for all the web properties it owns.\n\nIn 2010, Bitcoin value drops to $50.\n\nIn 2011, Bitcoin value rises again to $100, up $5.\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin value rises to $200, up $1.3.\n\nIn 2013, Bitcoin value rises to $500, up $0.9.\n\nLast year, Bitcoin value rises to a record high of $1,500, up $4.\n\nThe graphs shown by Smith show the volatility of Bitcoin's value over time over a 16-year cycle, each time varying significantly from another, depending on when that previous year occurred.\n\nYou can download Peter Smith's entire slide deck here, with more details on the history of the value of Bitcoins (from 1999 to today), and how to use Bitcoin. It is very, very, very, very powerful. In my opinion, it's the best presentation of the value of Bitcoin I have ever seen.\n\nI was very impressed and motivated by this presentation, to no end. The fact that Smith had to create such a presentation and document it in such a very technical and detailed way to an audience of the European Commission (a body whose interests include regulating digital currencies like Bitcoin and ensuring that currencies are as safe and stable as those being regulated in other jurisdictions) is a testimony to how difficult it is to do this kind of research in the context of a government body. It may take years (or even decades) to get funds to be put into such a project.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are like me and think that Bitcoin and its applications are revolutionary and exciting, this slide deck shows why you should be excited too, and it's a wealth of learning and information to be gleaned from its contents.\n\nAs for me … well, in my opinion it was also a wonderful time to be a Bitcoin geek. I would argue, in fact, that I am probably the geekiest person that ever came to this particular conference on the subject.\n\nPlease follow me on Twitter: @johnmayer.\n\nUpdate: I had to correct the date of the slide deck: from November 6th to 10th, 2011, not October 6th.", "length": 942, "ended": true}

While there's been a lot of speculation, there's been very little clarity. After last week's season 2 finale, a fan asked Arrow executive producer Marc Guggenheim, \"What about Nyssa?\" At the time, Guggenheim said that the answer to the question might not be immediately obvious because there's \"no magic, there's no mysticism,\" but since then we've seen an official character name announced for Nyssa, a major, major character shift!\n\nThe CW's president of content, Marc Guggenheim, just dropped the nitty-gritty details on The CW's upcoming Arrowverse spin-offs.\n\nThe announcement follows on from Guggenheim's recent announcement that Flashback is being developed as an animated movie. Flashback isn't being developed to be a full-blown series for The CW, but Guggenheim's comments indicate there could be other spin-off series in the works.\n\nWhile we already know that DC Comics will be getting a spinoff series featuring the Arrowverse's Canary, we don't know exactly how big The CW's Arrowverse spin-off series will be. Guggenheim has stated that he doesn't know what the show will be called, but Guggenheim has also stated \"there's going to be action in there.\" And while you can never be too sure, it sounds like we could be talking about a new show that hasn't been officially announced yet. Here are some of those quotes from Guggenheim's interview with Entertainment Weekly.\n\n\"There's going to be all kinds of action. There's going to be action, but it's not going to be Flash or Flash Forward — even though they're in that show.\"\n\n\"A good deal of the action there will take place across the Arrowverse universe. It will be episodic and not a complete season.\"\n\n\"There won't be an episode-long finale, though there might be a season-long mini-series. It might be more episodic than Flash Forward, but not so much that it just follows the timeline as much as it does. There might be several mini-sessions.\"\n\n\"I would be really pleased if I were to play that role of The Flash because I don't do 'Flashback.' I don't do it as much as he does, because I'm too busy as a character to work too many episodes of 'FlashForward.' And the Arrowverse is the most unique and compelling place to be.\"\n\n\"It all is episodic, with one or two episodes per season that we call 'mini-sessions.'\"\n\nThe full interview with Guggenheim is below, but in order to view it you'll need to have your FlashForward subscription active.

You can tell them that you believe you deserve a certain number of votes, or that you think these are unfair because people who support a political party should only get a certain number of votes. But if they do something nasty, you can ask them, \"So, just to be clear...what happens if someone tries really hard to get away with it? Can your elected representatives do anything about this?\"\n\nAnd this is a good place to point out that what really matters is what happens if people try to take away anyone's rights. I am not talking about individual rights, but about basic rights like privacy that a good government would respect even if some people wanted to infringe upon or take away those liberties.\n\nEven if it turns out that all your voters really do hate you, or you just don't know enough about those people to vote at all. You know that people like that will want to vote, and that the more people you have voting, the more their ideas will spread and the harder it will be to make them stop.\n\nPeople who complain loudly about government power always say they want some sort of government agency to fix it, but they are silent when it comes to how to make that happen.\n\nOne way to deal with this is to make sure that politicians who are elected are completely transparent about how they voted to help the people they represent. It's a good idea to make sure that candidates who take a lot of money from special interests agree to make it clear just how much.\n\nBut it's important to make sure that the candidates who actually represent the people who elected them actually agree to act with justice. This means ensuring that they don't take money from people who can influence people to behave just like what they want them to act like on matters of privacy.\n\nIf your elected officials don't agree to give up the right to decide who gets access to what private data they have or who gets to vote for them, then don't hold your breath that your representatives will. This leads to a very serious situation in which someone could come along and take money from people like that and use that power to use you against you. And if someone does that, then we can say that at least they have attempted to do something about the problem, but they have done nothing about those who abuse power. So there are good things about democracy for you, but good democracy cannot be allowed to work unless we get people for it to work on.\n\nWhat you need is to get more people and more organizations like ours to get involved. Not every problem can be solved by political action alone, but political action can make things better. But politics alone can't do all the things that are necessary to make things better.\n\nSome people might want to believe that the way to make things better is to elect more of Obama's friends into Congress and put all the people who vote against him on the Supreme Court. But the way that people usually get out of these situations is by having some new law that says, \"No laws of this sort shall be made in American politics.\" This is usually better. But it will never be perfect. No one really has the resources to write it to be perfect. We don't want it to be perfect.\n\nAnd to make it perfect, we need to start putting more people and more organizations like ours in charge of getting laws passed.\n\nSometimes it's hard to find a politician who actually feels like they have to act with justice. They might want to do what they can to stop this kind of thing, to do what they can to get those who abuse power off the ballot, but they're afraid. They worry that all the other politicians they get in power will use their position to do more and more awful things. So they hold off.\n\nWhen a politician does act with justice, it's actually a very good thing. But sometimes it takes people working together to get it. And when we put more people in charge of laws, it forces more legislation to be written with people's needs in mind.\n\nThe good news is that the political system in the US is not perfect.

Even the president is now on record calling on Congress to take action on the matter.\n\nBut as housing issues escalate around the country, the debate may soon escalate in Washington as well.\n\nAt a Washington meeting on the housing crisis Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., made a point of touting his new bipartisan bill to help combat the housing crisis and fix a failing mortgage foreclosure industry.\n\nHowever as he met with the Republican Leadership Conference, the White House was making an early pitch on its own bill to fix the housing market.\n\nLast week, White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn offered a five-year budget proposal to help banks, homeowners and other companies pay down their debt, with the federal government taking the lead. The White House also offered an outline of other measures lawmakers said are needed to combat the crisis.\n\nAt the same meeting, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., also proposed legislation aimed at fixing foreclosures by requiring private lenders to have the proper government loans on file.\n\nBut it is also unclear if the Republican leadership would be prepared to put a bill to a vote as quickly as they said they might.\n\nMeanwhile Democrats are making their own pitch for Congress to take up a bill that would do just that.\n\n\"Republicans have no plans whatsoever to do the Dodd-Frank reauthorization that I've been calling for,\" Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said last week. \"And what we can do in the Senate is get to work and get this done by the end of this year.\"\n\nDemocrats say the Republicans' pushback on Dodd-Frank is part of a long-term strategy to cripple or eliminate the law.\n\n\"The Republican leadership is really trying to throw good money after bad this time around to distract us from our agenda,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who has introduced Dodd-Frank reauthorization as the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nThe last time the Senate Banking Committee voted was on March 1, 2006. The new bill would have the following objectives:\n\n-Increase consumer protections for underwater homeowners.\n\n-Increase mortgage default warnings and warnings for underwater homeowners.\n\n-Require lenders to get federal loans to underwater homeowners.\n\n-Provide for a short supply of funds to underwater homeowners.\n\n-Require all bank holding companies to hold at least a 30 percent equity stake in mortgage holders.\n\n-Increase funding to homebuilders to assist homeowners.\n\n-Limit mortgage loan refinances from 50 percent of the value of the home to 50 percent.\n\n-Limit mortgage interest rate increases for underwater homeowners.\n\n-Require all banks to provide at least 30 percent of all mortgages for non-profit housing developments and for low-income seniors with lower down payments than 150 percent of the national average home price.\n\nIt is unclear from the legislation if that would even include the House and Senate versions of the Dodd-Frank overhaul.\n\nThe proposal is likely to run into Democratic opposition in the coming months because it is likely to require lenders to put more capital in the banking system that could lead to bigger mortgage risks.\n\nBanks have already invested a record amount of capital, according the Treasury Department. The proposed bill increases that amount.\n\nIf they fail to meet the increased capital requirements, bank shareholders would have the option to purchase those assets in order to avoid further losses.\n\nAs much as 60 percent of banks must meet the capital requirements by Sept. 30, or be forced to buy back all of their assets, including their shares, in order to avoid a default.\n\nBank executives have warned that these capital rules could drive up costs by more than 50 percent in some cases, said a Treasury official who is not authorized to speak publicly on pending legislation.\n\nThe proposal will be offered on the Senate Banking Committee floor on Tuesday. Sen.

But, to help you with all of that, we've rounded up 20 great places to find affordable loft space in Ottawa.\n\nThe cost of a loft space in Ottawa can be an expensive proposition. The average cost of a two-bedroom condo in the city is $800, more than many comparable markets — including major urban centres such as Toronto and Montreal. That doesn't include the cost of utilities (water and electricity), parking, and maintenance. The higher cost is one of many factors for many new home buyers, but it's still a challenge to find a place to call their own.\n\nBut there are some places in the city that are a good option for those seeking affordable loft space – particularly downtown, and especially in West Queen West (especially on King West). The area is rapidly becoming gentrified and that has been reflected in the amount of rental apartments being built in downtown.\n\nHere's where we like to look for affordable space:\n\n1.

{"id": 23, "text": "TAMPA — He was \"the greatest golfer of all time\" and, in the eyes of fans, the best in the sport for a generation; then he fell victim to a rare, untimely illness that killed him at age 31.\n\nFor 15 months before he died, Tony Finau was the most famous golfer of all time and one of a small cadre of true legends who dominated the sport for a generation.\n\nIn an article accompanying a video tribute to Finau by Michael J. Sullivan at the American Golf Association website, the A.G.A. President and CEO Stephen Collins called the 27-year-old \"a modern-day Arnold Palmer\" but offered not a few digs against him. Among the more pointed remarks was one about the golf star's love of beer butts — one of the reasons he was so famous, said Collins — and a comment on the \"choke grip\" that Finau favored.\n\n\"All I know about Tony is that he used to drink a lot,\" Collins said on Monday, recalling the early years.\n\nWhile most writers of this sort are probably less interested in the history of golf than in the way professional golf feels about itself, the comments and opinions from some notable golfers and commentators offer a valuable window into the nature of golf these days. There is some concern that fans and others might be getting too closely involved in what has long been a private and largely untutored sport, but I think Collins is more interested in what they are getting wrong.\n\nOne issue that is getting a lot of attention is the way in which the sport is changing in such a big way.\n\nWhen Finau died, there were no television cameras around to record the end, and so some details were hard to confirm. This may be understandable considering the short life span of Finau (and the fact that he was a member of the A.G.A.'s golf committee at the time of his death), but there is a lot of concern that the game is no longer in the shape that it once was. What has happened to the game?\n\nWhat is it that players, coaches, course designers and club owners are missing when they make sweeping changes? What was the game like as a kid? What is it like to be a professional golfer?\n\nThe A.G.A. article, titled \"How Tiger Grew Into a Superstar Who Made History,\" quotes numerous people who know Finau but did not attend the funeral, including his brother and friends, two women who played on the course with Finau, a golf buddy, a former player and a guy who worked for him for 30 years. The piece offers no commentary except for a few brief paragraphs in which it says that after leaving Augusta National in 1999, it seemed to the golf world that Finau was ready to turn pro. The article adds that when his body was brought to the hospital to be autopsied, the pathologist who was on call for that day, \"unexpectedly got the job done with the most accurate and detailed results of his career.\" The article is in some ways a kind of tribute to Finau as well as a way of acknowledging the game.\n\n\"Tony was really the best golfer of his generation,\" says Steve Spangler, who worked with Finau for the last two years of his career. \"He was a real leader and a very nice guy. He would be a good fit for a club someday.\"\n\nAfter Finau died, several news outlets reported that he was killed at a golf club in the Pacific Northwest. But no one has found any evidence that he was shot there; just how that particular club was rigged is still being investigated.\n\nSpangler has had a front row seat to this for several years but was not present for Finau's funeral at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tacoma. He is not involved any way with the business of the A.G.A., but he does have a degree in journalism and wrote several stories for a local paper.\n\nThe A.G.A.'s Collins did write a long obit for Finau published online.\n\n\"In a life of a lifetime, the end came unexpectedly and abruptly on May 3, 1999,\" he writes. \"We found him at his home in St. Petersburg, Florida, his head under his bed, his eyes closed. Despite multiple inquiries, no family member has been able to find the cause or reason for this tragedy.\"\n\nAt the time of that article, Finau was living on a golf course in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. In another obit, he noted he was looking forward to retirement, calling himself \"one of only a few dozen or so players remaining who continue to dominate in a sport that I have played for over 40 years.\"\n\nIn another interview, Finau said that he was at the final round of the 1999 U.S. Open and his buddy had a bad round and", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 25, "text": "A lot of people are confused by my love of this film. They think I love all the big guns or all the explosions, because the action was amazing and everything else is not important; I love the story, the writing, the acting, the action, the music. But they haven't read the book, they just haven't seen it.\n\nThe book is called Dune, and it was written about 100 years earlier than the movie, and it tells a story that goes from the desert to the seascape in six months. All roads lead to Paris in 1914. This is where the sandbars are, the dunes, of which there are more than one, just outside the walls of the city. There I wrote the first novel that I ever started writing, a story of the French resistance in Dune. It is called A Dance in Fire, and it takes place some 400 years before the events of the movie.\n\nWhat a great book, so interesting! In fact, a lot of people think it is apocryphal! [laughing]\n\nWell, that is a fair point! I started reading the book only a few months before the movie came out, and then I got the movie and I didn't know about the book, but that's the story, so let's read it!\n\nYes, so you read the French script. Where did you get it?\n\nOh, well, I read it. Of course, the movie was about 100 years old when I started reading it. So it isn't just the book. So it wasn't so much a movie that I read the script, like a book I had just finished. But there was this story that happened, it was about a young man called Ben. He had been a member of the desert resistance, a kind of a guerrilla band in a remote place in the heart of the desert. He was the only one who had managed to get back to Paris. After a while he came up against a huge group of guards, who were actually from a military regiment, who said you cannot travel between two cities with such a big army behind you. So they were really on the same level as we are today. So he thought he could go through with it. It was really hard for him to go through. It was like walking through space, but instead of air.\n\nAnd then he got so involved in the resistance, so he went through this journey through a couple of cities, and he started getting involved with the French Resistance, and he started becoming a true Resistance fighter. He was like a soldier in the desert. In short, it was hard for him to get all the information out of him about how to defeat the Empire to beat it down. You know, you don't want to tell the bad guys everything because they have spies and snipers and everything. So you have to go back to the basics and figure out how to defeat the Empire. I think I made him so obsessed that he was really obsessed, and the more he was obsessed, the more he became a real fighter, because he was really determined. So it was kind of a struggle to get him through, because he had the whole army behind him. And I think the whole of the book is about trying to do that and to make the French resistance successful.\n\nI thought you mentioned that the film was about 400 years old, but how old is it?\n\nIt's only 200 years. It's basically a sequel to the book – that's pretty much it.\n\nWow, interesting, because I read that you were influenced by some American films. For example, there is a scene in the book where you play a character named John Wayne who travels back in time and fights a battle for freedom.\n\nYeah, well, Wayne, the guy, was already a very good actor before I met him, he was in The Ten Commandments. In fact, I think it's the best action scene I've ever seen. He did The Right Stuff, which really was a wonderful movie. There was also this scene in The Godfather, which I found so entertaining, that just seemed to bring out everything in me, but it was only in one take.\n\nI was surprised at how much of it was a single take.\n\nYes.\n\nOh, I see. So you really love that scene.\n\nI thought so!\n\nYou and George Lucas worked on that fight as a duo?\n\nYeah, we did.\n\nYou were working together for about four years?\n\nNo, it was only about six. There were more time being a part of The Godfather in a more serious manner, and then there was this time off to work on Dune at the time, and then we were writing something on the side and doing a lot of writing when we were out on the ranch, because it didn't get dark very often on that ranch.

Although these results do not exclude non-therapeutic uses of pembrolizumab, as the findings are not strong, they do suggest that, except for the two tumor types studied in this study, pembrolizumab has an effect in two mouse models but it is not clearly defined whether it would increase tumors in other mouse models or other diseases,\" wrote researchers.\n\nThe researchers then did follow-up analyses to determine whether or not this imbalance was more than just cosmetic, meaning whether there was more to the results than is presently apparent.\n\n\"What we found is that pembrolizumab is not only not having any effect in these models, it is actually enhancing tumorigenesis in both mice and rats,\" said Dr. H. Bruce Lanphear, one of the authors and a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Center for Comprehensive Cancer Center in Baltimore, Md., one of the study's other authors.\n\n\"We think it is clear, the way we are doing our studies now and the way that the study is structured and designed, it is not just cosmetic differences, which is why we have done it differently and it clearly showed the changes that were occurring, so we cannot say it did not have any effect.\"\n\nIn a statement, Lanphear said the study provided \"compelling evidence\" that pembrolizumab caused tumors to grow and to \"increase in size.\"\n\nThe researchers said their finding suggests that this same type of imbalance may occur when other drugs are administered intravenously, a critical aspect of a cancer treatment.\n\nThe findings also suggested that in mice \"when compared to saline-treated controls, there was no evidence of effects from the combination of pembrolizumab and tamoxifen on growth, and no evidence of treatment-related effects for one mouse model compared to another, while two mice treated with only pembrolizumab had significantly increased tumor size and a tendency to grow larger,\" the researchers wrote.\n\n\"In contrast, in rats and mice treated during the same period with tamoxifen and tamoxifen plus pembrolizumab, the combination was found to enhance the growth of tumors and increase in size, while tamoxifen plus pembrolizumab was associated with reduced tumor growth in both male rats and female rats, while tamoxifen plus pembrolizumab plus tamoxifen caused no significant effect on the number of tumors in male rats or female rodents,\" the study's authors wrote.\n\n\nResearchers said there is currently no way to predict which type of therapy will be most likely to worsen treatment-related side effects, but they noted that further research may determine how the results translate to humans.\n\n\"This suggests a mechanism by which pembrolizumab is affecting other cancer types and has a non-therapeutic effect on other causes for tumors,\" wrote the authors. \"This is important information that needs additional study, particularly in light of new drug development that could include potential therapies to treat tumor growth and progression.\"\n\nThe study's second author was from the University of Miami's Institute for Neurotrauma, a medical teaching facility located in the South Floridita region of Miami.", "length": 920, "ended": true}

The central bank has for some time been concerned about the mortgage market and other financial markets. In March of 2011, for example, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that the Federal Reserve's failure to adequately address and mitigate the problems in the housing sector might put the recovery process at risk.\n\nIn January of 2012, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Evans, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal calling on the Federal Reserve \"to act now to reduce the level of leverage in our banks….The Fed must do what government officials in London have done: set a reasonable time frame for the introduction of a 'stress-testing' mechanism, which would provide a test for capital adequacy. And the Fed must also set a reasonable timeline for the adoption of capital rules.\"\n\nThe Fed set off a media firestorm. Many reporters criticized the Fed for not acting much sooner. For example, Paul Krugman—a Nobel laureate and the New York Times' editorial page editor—wrote in a New York Times column that the Federal Reserve was \"taking a long time to act against the housing crisis….It doesn't help to tell us that it will take until February or March to move anything, even if every other major economy was doing the same thing a hundred times faster.\"\n\nIf the Fed were to act too quickly, it could jeopardize the economy and financial markets. It should take longer to address the problems facing the housing market—and other financial markets—than it was to respond to the housing crisis in 2007-09. If the Fed were to respond too slowly, it could put off the inevitable adjustment that would be the next step in the recovery process by too long.\n\nThe fact that the Fed can never give the economy a \"safe harbor\" to avoid the next crisis does not mean that it cannot keep the economy from overheating—a potential problem if there are too many homeowners who can't afford to maintain their homes. I discussed this at length in a previous posting. I hope to explain how this occurs as we go through the next crisis scenario.\n\nIn this post, I'll use the words bubble and housing bubble interchangeably. This is because the Fed can only help stabilize the housing market if we accept that the housing bubble has burst. The housing bubble would, ultimately, fail, and all of the other housing markets—suburban housing, retail, multifamily housing—would collapse. However, the Fed can only help stabilize the housing market if we reject the notion that there is a housing bubble and instead accept that there is a housing and financial crisis out there—and that if those crises are to be avoided, we must keep the economy from overheating.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe Fed Must Set Baselines\n\nIf a financial crisis develops, the Fed is not required to do anything to prevent economic distress. Even if the Fed were to undertake extraordinary policies in response to impending financial crisis, it would not be legally required. The Fed is allowed to take whatever actions it likes, in response to any threat. It just can't do anything unless Congress first authorizes it to do so. As long as the nation's leaders of both parties remain committed to making our country solvent and the financial system stable, the Federal Reserve has no legal obligation to do anything to prepare for a financial crisis. It has no legal power over an individual mortgage. It only has legal power to \"maintain\" the US financial system. What it could do—or ought to do—if policymakers were to pass legislation authorizing it to do so is only those things it does under the existing regulatory framework.\n\nThe Fed's only obligation is to make sure that the financial system is strong and stable.\n\nIn particular, if policymakers set a higher standard for banks—which would increase its ability to take risks—the Fed needs to have the authority to do whatever it wishes. In the past, the Fed used this authority to avoid even a \"severe\" and \"near\" financial crisis. What the Fed must be able to do under current regulatory framework is to \"maintain\" the financial system. It can't do \"more\" in the way that its regulatory authority can, because that would create a new regulatory system. What it can do within a limited framework is to provide the financial system with a \"", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Each game has their strengths and flaws and a lot of them have continued to evolve over the years. What I'm looking to do is not attempt a definitive list of the most influential roleplaying games. My goal is to just list some of the more notable games I have enjoyed and look back at what was happening in the gaming world during those early years.

There are too many games today which have been played and loved by so many people to be even one of them. I have no interest in trying to predict the future, and I think many gamers would be happier for me to just pick one thing from all these titles, and stick with it.\n\nIt is my hope that by picking out some of these games you can have an enjoyable game experience with friends and family, because some people really do love all the things gaming has to offer, if only they knew how to use them.\n\nAs always, let me know in the comments if I'm missing a game which deserves mention.", "length": 469, "ended": true}

{"id": 35, "text": "The number of Americans who are uninsured jumped 14% over the past year while the number who have no health insurance jumped 13%, according to the annual report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Kaiser report tracks data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a \"Healthy People 2020\" index.\n\n\"Healthcare access and affordability have long been a concern for the nation,\" said Mark Baldassare, one of the report's co-authors and a senior health economist at the foundation. \"Americans are seeing the consequences of a broken system and want more options. The report is also a snapshot in time as we enter the fourth quarter of 2017; the number of uninsured will increase next year, and the number who have no insurance will grow even faster.\"\n\nThere's a lot more we could say about what's going on with our country's health, so let's get back to the numbers. For years, the Affordable Care Act, sometimes known as Obamacare, has done a good job of reducing overall health costs. However, the Kaiser report finds that about half of all American adults do without health insurance at some point in their lives. And, if the ACA were to completely collapse, as some analysts predict, there's a good chance nearly two-thirds of American adults would be uninsured.\n\nWhat will happen if Obamacare is repealed?\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does provide subsidies for consumers to purchase coverage through federally operated exchanges. The subsidies vary wildly among each state, but the average is typically as much as $300 per month, or about $6,800 a year. This helps people of all ages afford insurance.\n\nBut because so much of Obamacare's funding comes through taxes and regulations, the health law needs some mechanism to make up the difference for those who don't get any help from the tax credits. If the ACA were repealed, health insurers would have to pay out a portion of the taxes they paid in order to help cover people with modest incomes.\n\nHow would repealing Obamacare do this?\n\nUnder the Congressional Budget Office's latest forecast, the Congressional Budget Office believes repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase the number of uninsured by 10 million people, more than double the number that already have health insurance.\n\nThe CBO doesn't expect that Obamacare would cover everyone in the nation's individual insurance market. Instead, it would increase the number of Americans who have one or two affordable-bundle plans or a few non-bundled plans with high deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe CBO estimates that about 6 million people would choose to get insurance through Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, which is available to low-income people between 138 percent and 400 percent of poverty; and about 4 million people would choose to get insurance from the marketplaces.\n\nHowever, those who don't have any health insurance would likely be excluded from most of Obamacare's provisions.\n\nHow much of the decline in insured people could be explained by an economic downturn or other reasons\n\nThe number of insured people is already declining. About 11 million of them -- nearly a quarter of the U.S. population -- were uninsured in 2009 and 2010, the Pew Research Center estimated in 2013. The number has stayed about steady since then.\n\nPew also found that \"the number of people without health insurance dropped by about 10 million between 2006 and 2009, according to census data.\" In 2014, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the number of people enrolled in insurance plans fell to 62.1 million.\n\nBut there's more to it than that. Here are five reasons why the number of uninsured Americans will likely continue to climb in the coming years.\n\n1. Employer plans may no longer be able to pick up the slack on benefits after Obamacare\n\nEmployer health plans are already being told they can't offer their workers health insurance until 2016. The CBO estimates that, of the people who don't have employer-sponsored coverage in 2014, half would lose coverage in 2015 because they don't get any federal subsidies.\n\nEven if they did, that doesn't account for the cost to insurers. As the CBO notes, health insurance costs are rising because employers are having to offer lower-cost plans.\n\n\"If employers are starting to get more creative with their offerings, many of these people won't have access to those new coverage options when they do get these subsidies, and therefore won't qualify for the coverage subsidies in the marketplaces,\" Baldassare said.\n\nThe effect of that in some cases is that less healthy people would leave the individual market, boosting the insurance pool among healthy consumers.\n\n2. Older Americans won't get the coverage they want after Obamacare\n\nOne of the reasons why the number of Americans without health insurance is rising is that it's harder to get coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe law requires most people to buy insurance or pay a penalty, but older Americans -- those over 65 who don't qualify for Medicaid or the Children's", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

He said \"it is clear this is a verdict that will make a difference, because it sends a clear message to every college and university that sexual assault is wrong.\"\n\nSchwab said Maines never faced a hearing before the judge, and there is no evidence that the university \"treated Nicole differently\" compared to other students who come forward with complaints of sexual assault.\n\nThe student had filed a lawsuit in 2013 claiming that the university improperly failed to respond to the assault complaints, including the ones she made to police officers. But Judge Lynn DiGregorio ruled earlier this year that Maines did not have standing to sue, since there were no documents filed, or any witnesses.\n\nMaines, now 22, has sued the university, accusing it of mishandling the complaint and \"bowing to pressure from a school administration that sought to intimidate and embarrass her,\" as The New York Times reported.

Bob Corker, Tennessee Republican, said.\n\nObamacare had a provision that banned insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing health conditions or charging sick people higher prices. The House GOP bill would eliminate this \"Cadillac tax,\" but leave the law's prohibition intact. (Read more: Healthcare bill could leave insurance industry without money for essential services)\n\nThe committee said it was not making a cost estimate for the impact on consumers under the bill, but that its previous draft showed that the repeal of the law's Cadillac tax would increase the price of products like prescription drugs by $1,700 -- or 9.9% -- for a family of four -- for a product that includes prescription drugs.\n\nAlso included in the bill are numerous provisions that the committee said would increase costs for people in particular parts of the country.\n\nThese include the elimination of a special tax on the sale of medical devices, which would increase the cost of some devices by $10,000 for a product that includes at least three major medical equipment components. These include a coronary artery bypass device, a bypass procedure and an angioplasty.\n\nAnother provision in the Senate bill, which would eliminate the taxes imposed on manufacturers of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, would cost $1,000 per $100 spent on the medical devices tax. The House Democratic version of the Affordable Care Act also would eliminate such taxes.

In the past, employers generally had to pay the penalty if the participant was required at the time to have health care coverage. (See more about the penalty.)\n\nThe committee said the $1,000 figure represents a conservative estimate but that it should be considered in light of the $150 billion in new revenues the legislation would generate when fully implemented.\n\nThe committee said the provisions that would raise costs for some consumers include:\n\nMedicaid and CHIP, the two major insurance programs for the poor and the disabled, would increase federal funds devoted to the programs by $7 billion over the 2016-2021 period, the estimates said.\n\nInsurance premiums would increase an average of 6.2% from 2016 to 2027. Those increases could be covered, the committee said, by capping cost-sharing payments to insurers. The bills would impose a $2,500 cap on costs for people on Medicaid. Those caps would be indexed to the Consumer Price Index.\n\nHouse Republicans' original plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act through its budget reconciliation process had $772 billion in annual savings over 10 years, a \"dramatic\" increase over the $300 billion savings the House bill would generate each year.

The average poverty rate for children and teens there was 12.7 percent in 2011, up from 10.9 percent in 2010 and 5.3 percent in 2009, according to South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control data included in the study.\n\nOverall, child poverty rates in the South are up 8.6 percent since 1990 and up more than 24 percent since 2009, say the researchers. Poverty increased in both genders, but the increase was significantly higher in men.\n\n\"These results highlight the importance of reducing child poverty rates in the South in the wake of the Great Recession,\" the researchers conclude.\n\n— By CNBC's Katie Little", "length": 391, "ended": true}

For some, that's simply not something you are prepared to take on.\n\nA new study conducted by University of Wisconsin-Madison scientist and University Medical Center of South Carolina assistant professor of medicine Robert Sapolsky shows that some individuals who do not have a certain gene variant are more likely to develop autism.\n\nScientists have known for some time that there are people who have a more rapid growth rate, a narrower waist, longer limbs, a larger face and a smaller head. But in this study for the first time, scientists have developed a way to determine if those who have a \"gene variant\" -- specifically in a gene called TRPA1 -- are more likely to develop autism.\n\n\"We didn't anticipate that autism or other types of developmental disorders would increase risk of these gene variants and that it would be associated with such a variant,\" said Sapolsky, a scientist in the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.\n\nTo find out if someone has a certain genetic variant, scientists first had to determine if their immune system was responding to something. If it is, the person might have a viral infection because of having the gene variant.\n\nIn this study, Sapolsky and his team looked at the immune response to an unknown compound. They found that of 1,854 individuals from a community clinic, 6.8 percent had an unknown reaction and 2.2 percent had an unknown reaction.\n\n\"For the most part, the participants had no symptoms of these reactions. So, we have these people in our study, who have no symptoms, and we have these people with this gene variant and they have the reaction,\" Sapolsky said. \"So, we have a few different types of gene variant and these are the people that we see with the problem.\"\n\nSapolsky said this was not the last chance the team would take to find a genetic cause of developmental disorders.\n\n\"We're looking for more people,\" he said. \"We will continue.\"\n\nIf the findings are correct, some parents may wonder why their child would have a gene variant. According to Sapolsky, the reason could be two-fold. One, genes like TRPA1 have been linked to autism, and two, this variant was associated with autism when the study was done.\n\n\"Because they were associated with autism, it was hard to miss,\" Sapolsky said. \"We can't say how [the gene] works because we have no idea why it was linked to autism, but the fact that the risk is elevated for some people, that could mean we have some potential problems with the immune system. That's part of the reason why these people would have this gene variant. It's an easy way to find out if you have it.

{"id": 47, "text": "For centuries, women around the world have been told that pregnancy is an \"unwanted baby.\" But in 2016 a few women are challenging that. From Ireland to Argentina, women are reclaiming the word \"pregnant women.\"\n\nHere in the US, we refer to pregnancy as the inevitable \"maternity leave\" that mothers take after giving birth. It's a phrase that makes people feel safe. At best, we accept this phrase as a polite way of referring to the temporary time for \"baby-making.\" But to hear women talk about it now, it's not quite what it used to be.\n\nAs the women in our culture continue to speak about maternity leave, it's clear that the world of maternity leave is not where our mothers would prefer it to be. When faced with the realities of pregnancy and parenting, there are no more pleasant or comfortable places to fall off into.\n\nMany women are choosing to take less time off — whether it's because of health problems or the physical demands of having a baby.\n\nI want to be here for your baby, whatever your feelings and needs are. The thing to remember is that your feelings are only important if you say you have them, and if you want others to take responsibility for how you feel. That sounds simple enough, right?\n\nWell, as moms, we don't have that luxury.\n\nIf I'm feeling stressed about being in the workplace, but don't really give a fuck, that doesn't mean my stress is a good reason to do it. It might be that I just didn't know how to be a good mom. I might feel like what I'm doing is for my own self-preservation, not about you or my baby. But if you have questions about this, please don't feel alone. There are professionals that can help — and that's what my friend and mentor at the Nourish Project calls, \"taking things personally.\" Nourish means caring for yourself and others. It means being a healthy, living, vibrant, compassionate adult.\n\nAs a mother, in my family, this has meant not leaving my baby alone for long after I leave the house. While this isn't easy for me, it's also not uncommon. We often have work and family commitments at the same time. So how does this relate to maternity leave?\n\nI think the answer is that for many women, it's not enough to take the baby and leave.\n\nA few years ago, my daughter was born. I was in the hospital for two or three weeks, and by mid-July I was able to tell the world I wanted to spend time with her. With a good night's sleep in hand, and an infant to look after, I took my time with her and was more involved with her, and the world around her. While I was still a workaholic, and I didn't have any other work obligations at that time, I decided to take a few weeks off. And not only did I take one of my biggest projects, but I took a few days off to decompress. It was one of those things that's hard to describe: the feeling of relaxation and relief I got from seeing how much my daughter was growing together with my husband and kids.\n\nAt the same time, after a baby, you start to develop that feeling of needing time off. I know I do: I need to be more present with other people. I feel like I need to be there to make sure they have all they can handle and are able to do things with their kids that they should be able to do alone. It can sometimes be hard for me to talk about this with people, but when I try, it's actually easier. I get a lot of questions about how little I spend all day on my baby, but I don't need to get any real details. I don't take anything for granted that my baby isn't growing, and she's growing with me.\n\nIt's easy for me to take a few days off to decompress in that environment, and I feel like I am more present for my son and for the world around him, without having to get into a whole lot more detail about the ways that I'm exhausted from my own work and family commitments.\n\nBecause in my case, I have this very normal need to be around someone else when I'm overwhelmed. I don't need to hold him, not when I need to do so myself. I needed some time off to recover and be better prepared for his first few years; to be a healthier parent that allows my husband and I to be more present with him. I was going into a situation, being a professional who spent her life managing people, and I was going into a situation where I was about to spend a year working as a mother who was going to spend a year managing people. Even though we were married in the beginning and still spend a lot of time together now, I need some time off", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 49, "text": "For most of them, it's a matter of getting a ride or catching a train or bus. For others of us, it's about taking public transportation, walking or cycling. That means some people will be using their bikes (or just a bicycle) to get around even for short distances in places that are already well-served by transit.\n\nSo it's important that bike infrastructure reflects that.\n\nThat's certainly the focus of a new study by a team of transportation researchers at the University of British Columbia and University College London.\n\nFor more than two decades, B.C.'s Transportation Assessment Office has recommended building bike lanes and paths, but hasn't adopted them as a solution because of an inability to gauge how effective those changes are. In fact, the study found it would be more effective to find out how many people will rely on bikes to travel through a neighborhood, instead of trying to guess the future as you would a map.\n\nFor starters, B.C.'s assessment office says the study was based on extrapolations, so the data are \"not a real estimate of the effect of bike measures on the transportation environment.\" (Indeed, a study last year by the UBC and UCL in London found the use of cycling by high school students was linked to lower costs, greater safety and lower pollution.)\n\nSecond, the transportation assessment office found this study relies heavily on \"assumptions and methods that have not been validated or tested elsewhere.\"\n\nAccording to the study, many of the assumptions used in the study's calculations are incorrect, and will \"only lead to overestimation of the potential effect on bike use.\" Those assumptions, the report reads, were \"based on high-constrained assumptions about the proportion of non-bicyclist trips that could be conducted by bicycle.\"\n\nFor starters, most of B.C.'s major cities don't have bike paths or bike lanes. And many of those cities lack a variety of infrastructure that makes it easy for people to cycle. In B.C., the assessment office says biking is mostly limited to one-hour tours (often with limited facilities and amenities), which means the city is missing some of the benefits of more sustainable modes of transportation, such as more bike-friendly schools, less traffic and less pollution.\n\nThe study also fails to take into account how many local communities have \"high level\" bike lanes, meaning bike lanes are easily accessible and easy to access by even the most frugal members of society.\n\nOther potential issues the report points out include:\n\nBicycles don't fit on many vehicles.\n\nNot all bike lanes are made with the same characteristics and designs; some are wider, longer and narrower to account for vehicle width – leading to a reduction in the overall capacity of bike lanes. In some cases, bike lanes are not protected, meaning the lanes are narrower and provide less protection from other road users during peak hours so a vehicle can get through a bike lane smoothly.\n\nBut while not all bike lanes are designated as bike lane-protected, it's not an indicator of the level of protection that's provided. Many have the same type of protected bike lane with wider, longer and narrower spaces, and are often not marked bike lanes. This could lead some to use bike lanes for more personal reasons such as \"safe travel\" in order to be close to a bus, or if they're not used as designed they can cause trouble for people riding in bike lanes.\n\nBicycle facilities can be inconsistent between facilities. Some are marked as a bike lane, and some are not; some are clearly marked as a bike lane and others don't really have one. Often, people don't realize that a bike lane is marked with a bike lane until they are too far away or need to park.\n\nThe assessment office says there is a \"vast range of variations\" of bike facilities across the country. \"It is also unclear whether there are sufficient data or criteria to quantify how bike facilities should be designed and maintained as compared to other transportation modes.\" (There are exceptions: Seattle, San Francisco, Portland and New York City all have bicycle facilities that measure in a similar size.)\n\nAnd not everyone can or wants to ride a bike, so there are \"other important reasons for not biking to work that are not captured in the current model.\" For example, the assessment office noted, people who work in a more economically challenged urban environment may have greater access and opportunities than people who don't, which makes it difficult to estimate the impact of better bicycling facilities.\n\nThe report says that while some of what the study finds, such as the \"increasingly popular use of cycling as a mode of travel, has been well-documented,\" there are still significant concerns about the impact bike facilities might have on people who are not so inclined to cycling.\n\n\"The results from this and other reports from transportation planners and urban designers are that it is too difficult to accurately assess the impact that", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

We have seen the price of every single item go up or down every day and that is why we have to put up with these issues.\n\nJust to show you just how much it adds up, the average cost for groceries in 2014 was the worst ever. It went up 20%, even with inflation. If you live in Los Angeles and you purchase your groceries at Walmart, you will pay about $3.52 a gallon. The average in the United States is $3.32.

That may be very pricey for you, but it's a good deal for Walmart.\n\nYou can also save money by using coupons and saving money by not shopping where you see this type of thing.\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but these are just a few of many mistakes that come into play.\n\nBut now you know how to avoid these.

What makes them so great is they're willing to break traditional genre stereotypes in order to get their music heard and their art spread. I'm thinking about their recent, highly-anticipated comeback this summer and what it means for the music industry as a whole. Dixie Chicks frontman and song writer Taylor Swift has been a vocal supporter of the women's community for a long time for her personal cause. One of the things she's done to advance the cause is to donate a portion of her royalties to women's causes.\n\nYou might not be aware of her work as Taylor Swift, but she's actually an incredible champion for the causes she cares about. Her work is a huge part of why she has such a massive following. People enjoy the song, but it was also her willingness to help others that really makes it a huge success. It's not just that she's been a huge advocate for the Dixie Chicks, but that she's put her wealth of experience as a music business owner to work for charities.\n\nRecently, Taylor has opened up about what's next for the Dixie Chicks. Her latest public statement on social media says that the band is now in a studio with new music. In her first tweet of a new song, she describes a group of people she's been getting to know.\n\nThis is your next major release. The next official song you will be working on will be a song that brings hope to people all over the world. It will show the power of unity, of love, and forgiveness. It will also remind all of us to keep loving each other, and keep our heads held high as we go forward in life! — Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) March 29, 2016\n\n\"This is your next major release. The next official song you will be working on will be a song that brings hope to people all over the world.\"\n\nShe's using the word \"major\" in the sentence, and, by \"major release,\" I mean that a new single would likely be released within the next year or two. We'll see.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to a Taylor Swift solo album, and hopefully even singing at the inauguration next month. It's hard to tell how much of a chance this new album will take in the industry, but I'm excited to see what comes next. I can only hope those lyrics are as true to our world than those of past Dixie Chicks songs. (And the songs she's written have been nothing short of brilliant.)\n\n—\n\nImage: Twitter", "length": 603, "ended": true}

I will continue to speak and to encourage and to engage and to push in that direction.\n\nBut it won't be my priority. In terms of the Republican Party — which includes my party — it'll be, \"Do we want to spend more money on the program to support the women who are going to have the children?\n\nWe have to do that.\"\n\nIf you keep saying, \"No, that's not the right focus for us,\" you may lose votes, if you don't go there.\n\nThat's very important as a leader among all conservative intellectuals and leaders in this country.\n\nBut, by the same token, if you say, \"Oh, what are you going to do in terms of domestic issues when you've got an economy that's going bad?\n\nIt's not the right issue. The American People want to have an economy that can provide for all the families that are living above the poverty line, that can provide for those who are working, that can provide for those who are in jail, that can provide for those that are in need, that can provide for those who are poor.\n\nSo that's the issue. And it's not where I'm going. It's not where I'm coming from.\n\nIt's not where the party wants to take it, and those issues are going to dominate for a long time — until they're resolved either by the president in the next four years or by a new Congress.\n\nIn other words, this is the next three years, not just in this country, but also in all world power relationships.\n\nWhat's more, because this comes from a lot of real people within the conservative movement, who know that I'm a voice for change, not just to the Republicans, but around the world as well, I think the American People are looking at that issue and seeing that change for a long, long time.\n\nI'll be doing a whole lot of talk about this topic in the weeks and months to come.", "length": 796, "ended": true}
{"id": 55, "text": "I'm pretty excited to start my new career in technology. I graduated from school this past year, and it's finally starting to pay off!\n\nI was working on developing a cool application. It was for an internet of things company, and I thought it would be easy enough to just get an app, test it using a variety of scenarios, maybe even release it.\n\nUnfortunately, I came up short. I never finished my prototype, and spent too much time learning how to develop web applications, instead of focusing on making a product.\n\nThis is why I'm starting my new job at the beginning of the year. I want to share my journey with you, and show my first mistakes that made me give up on my design dreams.\n\nThe worst experience in my coding career\n\nA few months ago, when it was time to start my new job, I had already built a prototype for my app, that is, a working application that could be integrated into a web-app project.\n\nThe following morning I went out to the garage and got to work.\n\nFirst thing that I did was to open up a browser. I did this with the help of Bootstrap. But in order to get a decent web page with a bunch of different styles, I found that I would have to have all the styles in the code in my CSS file, which I could then add with Javascript.\n\nThis seemed pretty wasteful, as I could add everything in CSS with almost no effort. It would have just been a mess to write the same file for each platform and platform size, even if everything was in one package.\n\nThe problem with having a lot of styles in one file\n\nThe solution I came up with had several disadvantages. If you have a lot of styles in one file, the page is not very flexible. Everything that the user sees on the page will not be as optimized as they could have hoped.\n\nFor an application like my app, I can keep a small part in this little CSS file and only use it if I want to change anything on the page. This way, all the assets look great, but I don't have to keep a big CSS file in the root of my project. This is very handy for a web application, where lots of assets will need to be loaded in all the time. However, if your company does lots of web development, you may want to store all the assets in one big CSS file, so that the page is able to respond well to changes on the server.\n\nFor web development, it is nice to be able to move assets around easily.\n\nI did not want to build my project using a small style file. I chose a solution that had lots of styles, such as a header like HTML <h1> element, and then I could add my HTML with Javascript to create a header like this: <h1>My Home Page</h1>\n\nThe problem is that I realized that the HTML <h1> tag would have many different styles, so it's not possible to add all the styles without losing any fidelity to the underlying page. If a user clicks on the new page on my page, all the styles in this tag disappear, rendering the page in a blank gray. It was very messy!\n\nAfter this, I quickly realized that if I ever want to write my own styles for some of the styles in the <h1> tag, it will have to go in another file that is in the source tree of the HTML, instead of just loading it in my \"CSS\" file.\n\nWhat else can go in my stylesheet, but JavaScript\n\nI needed my entire app to be built with JavaScript.\n\nThere are tons of great tutorials on how to write your own JavaScript. However, for my app, we are not going to build all of our styles with JavaScript. Instead, we are going to create a JavaScript file for every style we can. I'll talk about how I went about it below.\n\nTo create this JavaScript file, I wrote a simple javascript code that checks for every CSS file in the root. Then it loops by file to find a style for each file, and calls the style function in this style for all styles.\n\nAs it turns out, this code works pretty well. It was the first time I saw the benefits of using loops. So simple really. The main disadvantage is that you can't control how all the styles in this file are loaded into memory. If you don't know what styles are in what file, you can't change which parts you use in your JS file.\n\nThat may not matter to you. If you aren't worried about performance issues, it may even be an advantage.\n\nI decided to give it a try. I used a web console to make sure that everything was downloading correctly, and so that everything looks good.\n\nAfter that, I created two files: js.css , and js", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

After I returned from Ukraine, I was asked to chair a working group of U.S. intelligence agencies to study the Russian government's role in its cyberinfiltration efforts. I was later appointed to the National Intelligence Council's Russia Working Group.\n\nMy job in the Obama administration's National Security Council (NSC), where I worked alongside my country's top spy, General Alexander Vershbow, was to guide the president's policy toward Russia, one that I personally took pains to make clear would not weaken U.S. influence around the world. The administration's efforts to make common cause with Russia were never meant as any kind of a rebuke or attack on the Soviet Union. Rather, they were intended to send the signal that the United States would continue our close and close relationship with the Kremlin for many years to come, and that we would support Russia as it worked to rebuild its economy and political system. I was particularly sensitive to how Putin treated American democracy activists whose activities in Ukraine were often peaceful.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, though, has cast Russia's election meddling as a one-off event. If anything, he has suggested that this was only the latest example of Russian cyberattacks on Washington and state election systems around the world, that it was a small price to pay for the benefits the U.S. received for its support of democracy, and that the Russians had the \"great power\" status they needed to be treated that way.\n\nAs we begin the first full year under this administration in which major questions about the Russian role in the election may be asked by the world, it's important to remember that the United States and our European allies are already taking steps to reinforce their commitments to NATO and European defense. These steps include new missile defense systems deployed at Poland and the E.U. bases that will be used to protect them; NATO's presence on Russia's border with Poland and the Baltic States to keep Russia at bay; and new defense cooperation with European allies.\n\nThe U.S. military continues to increase its commitment to Eastern Europe. The alliance announced the deployment of additional rotational forces, and an announcement today from General Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander, that the alliance would contribute four more ships to the Baltic Fleet. The U.S. will provide two more rotational forces to the Estonia and Latvia air bases to protect air traffic and improve capabilities at those bases. And the U.S. Air Force will maintain at least one additional aircraft carrier group in the Baltic Sea. Finally, the U.S. will deploy an additional six battalions, including four infantry battalions, at an additional two military installations along Europe's western periphery.\n\nThe U.S. will also contribute to the fight against Daesh, the extremist Sunni terrorist organization in Iraq and Syria, including aircraft, special operations forces, trainers, air-to-ground munitions, logistics, intelligence and reconnaissance equipment and combat troops from three U.S. Army brigades, eight Air Force brigades and eight Marine Corps brigades.\n\nThe President and Congress have the tools they need to protect the country against attack, but it's clear that they are going to need help from Washington as they confront the threat from the North Korea threat, the rise of the Islamic State, terrorism, cyberattacks and Russia. There are other actions the U.S. can take to help defend our interests, including economic sanctions and economic and diplomatic sanctions. But it's also clear that we cannot afford to just take our foot off the gas on protecting our national security interests.", "length": 832, "ended": true}

While some high carb diets have been advocated as a way to promote weight loss in obese women -- especially those with \"metabolic syndrome,\" characterized by high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and a large waist circumference -- there is currently no scientifically-backed, high-carbohydrate diet that can deliver sustainable weight loss for this population without the side effects that many previously used.\n\n\"Over the past decade, high-calorie diets associated with metabolic syndrome have been recommended by the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews as a strategy for weight loss in overweight women,\" writes author Erika Pajak, Ph.D., from the Department of Preventive Cardiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \"Recent work in humans and animal models has shown that, when diet and lifestyle are balanced according to dietitians' recommendations, weight loss from dietary intervention is possible with a variety of methods, such as caloric restriction, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets, high-protein diets, moderate or low-fat diets, and the use of combined or low-calorie supplements.\"\n\nPajak and her colleagues studied weight loss and body fat loss in overweight and obese women ages 40 to 69 years. The researchers used data collected in 2012 from 3,837 participants in the Women's Health Initiative-Randomized Placebo-controlled RCT trial, designed to investigate the effects of diets that consisted of both a high-carbohydrate meal and a high-fat meal.\n\nDuring the trial period, participants received a menu at the beginning of each week with four meals served in a four-hour period of time, totaling 15 grams of carbohydrate per meal. The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBBI).\n\nThe authors report that after accounting for body weight and body fat, obese women who did not go on a high-carbohydrate diet lost more weight and had greater body fat weight than their weight-loss diets that included a low-carbohydrate meal. The subjects ranged in age from 42 to 77 years old with an average BMI of 25.2, whereas the average body weight of the women in the study was 72.4 kg (154 lbs). The subjects had received counseling regarding the possible adverse consequences of low carbohydrate diets in past research that looked at the effects on blood pressure, blood lipids, glucose, and insulin levels. In addition, the diets in this study required an average of 1.6 pounds of carbohydrate per day, and the subjects used either an all-sugar formula or a low-carbohydrate diet with added fruits and vegetables, which are widely accepted for weight loss.\n\nPajak explains that although the \"Metabolic Syndrome\" -- which included high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity -- is well known, little has been done to measure the effects of this condition, which is characterized by the accumulation of fat in abdominal and subcutaneous fat. \"Our results provide strong evidence that these diets are not as effective for reducing body fat because the metabolic syndrome is so variable,\" she says. The low-carbohydrate diets decreased waist circumference relative to participants on the high-carbohydrate diets (p < .001). However, \"despite the reduction in waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio remained unchanged, suggesting that the diet composition may have increased visceral abdominal fat,\" the authors note.\n\n\"Given that low-fat diets are most widely used in the obesity treatment arena and have been shown to have superior effects on body composition compared with low-carbohydrate diets, it is important to understand why the low-carbohydrate diet does not seem to affect weight loss as much as high-carbohydrate diets,\" says Pajak. \"Our findings reinforce the need for future trials to investigate whether these diets are equally effective or effective for different health outcomes or to look at additional potential mechanisms behind these results.\"", "length": 852, "ended": true}

{"id": 60, "text": "LIMELAND, Ohio -- After eight seasons in the league, the Cleveland Browns' quarterback position is in flux.\n\nBrowns offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, who has worked with Manziel for two seasons in the NFL, said \"a lot will be made\" of the veteran's decision on his future.\n\n\"It's something that we've tried to address for many, many, many years, and one person that's the only person that knows that,\" Shanahan recalled. \"We do have a coach, and when that coach is not in the room, that's a problem, and if one of those guys decides not to be right here, you've got all that's wrong with it. It's not to say that you're going to lose your job. It's just to say that if that happens, I think you have to understand that I'm not a part of that.\"\n\nManziel's presence as a first-year starter was supposed to be the primary factor in Cleveland's decision between second-year quarterback Brian Hoyer and fifth-round rookie Josh McCown.\n\nInstead, Manziel left the team in late December and returned to school in January, during which he gained significant coaching staff knowledge during his absence. For example, Manziel was a former player who spent the past two years practicing with the Browns. So he was in the room for meetings and film review.\n\n\"So he has a great relationship with a lot of the coaches and a great connection that he can get a little more information from them than a lot of other quarterbacks,\" Shanahan said. \"There is probably a greater chance to get it across there than other guys.\"\n\nManziel said he wanted to remain active in the Browns' coaching process. He took part in offseason activities with the team and played in a preseason game.\n\nAnd he's trying to figure out a new offense. The Browns drafted Austin Davis and have two of his former students on the roster, second-year center Alex Mack and third-round offensive lineman Johnny Manziel. The latter is on the practice squad.\n\nThere was a time, earlier in his career, when Manziel might have been too good and might have been too high priced for Cleveland. The Browns traded up to get Manziel in 2012. Last season, after he lost the job to Hoyer to start the season, they turned to Manziel and Hoyer again.\n\nSo there was a disconnect at times as the team lost several offensive weapons. They traded for tight end Gary Barnidge last year. They traded for receiver Corey Coleman and traded for wide receiver Travis Benjamin. They drafted running back Duke Johnson, but he got hurt and was the team's last significant draft choice.\n\nBut Manziel showed this offseason he was ready to play with an offense that he's familiar with. Hoyer had been a backup before he landed as the starting quarterback, and Manziel was the backup at times. He had a 4-19 record as a starter in four NFL seasons.\n\nManziel has struggled with accuracy, has had a bit of a temper and has had two serious off-field incidents with the law. He has struggled with consistency and consistency has led to questions.\n\n\"It's something that we've tried to address for many, many years, and one person that's the only person that knows that. We do have a coach, and when that coach is not in the room, that's a problem, and if one of those guys decides not to be right here, you've got all that's wrong with it. It's not to say that you're going to lose your job. It's just to say that if that happens, I think you have to understand that I'm not a part of that.\" -- Kyle Shanahan\n\nStill, the Browns won 11 games last season. They won the AFC North division title, clinched a playoff berth and they moved within a game of the No. 1 overall selection in the NFL Draft - the best spot to land a quarterback.\n\nThe franchise has spent several drafts trying to find one. McCown, who was the No. 1 quarterback last season, played some down field routes last year. And Manziel has been asked to play an important role because the team needs to upgrade at one spot. They've been able to get one player, in the third round, who is likely to be a backup, on their roster.\n\nIt is what it is. But it's a process and he'll be given all the right information to make an informed decision about his future.\n\nSo until then, he'll continue to work on his fundamentals and get his fundamentals figured out.\n\nBut Shanahan is ready to give Manziel the time he needs to improve his consistency. And perhaps he will go out on a down note so he feels better about his future.\n\n\"It's a difficult question and you can't make that decision about when it comes,\" Shanahan said. \"There's an element of being in the right state of mind and knowing", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 61, "text": "The United States (US) government, in coordination with the US Military, CIA, and Mossad, was involved through several agencies in the creation of the 9/11 plot. In his memoirs, the CIA officer and 9/11 Truther David Ray Griffin, describes his meeting with the head of the Saudi Embassy in Washington, the head of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, and a high ranking US official, in which the American official said that 'the Saudis had known about the impending attack for a long time, but they couldn't stop [it] because they were funding it, and they [the Saudis] were funding the terrorists, and the terrorists were getting American dollars'. As we have discussed previously in this documentary, these funds were used to purchase military planes, to fund the training and recruitment of al-Qaeda operatives, and to buy fuel to fuel their planes, so when September 11 came there was no question of a cover up. These men were not alone. A group of military and intelligence officers met in their respective offices at Langley, in the US Air Force or the US Army, to discuss this horrific day. They included Major General Ralph Eberhart, the US Army, former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Intelligence, former Director of National Intelligence, Commander of the US Strategic Command, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They met on an off the record basis in a secure basement command post.\n\n\nAnd the men met in a room with doors only allowed to those in full uniform. They had to sign a document saying they never spoke openly with anyone in their entire military careers. They did not want to be quoted or named, for fear of retaliation. General Eberhart said he was not surprised that the Saudis and Israel had gone ahead with the attack. He said they knew that a lot of the US leadership was afraid on the 9/11 matter, because they knew in advance that the 9/11 attack would be carried out by the CIA or the Mossad. The reason why this government did not know about the attack in advance, he said, was that no one was allowed inside the meeting. He said 'they were only allowed to speak to them, through the door, if they were in full uniform'. The US government, in collaboration with Israel, had planned to blame al-Qaeda for 9/11, and that they would then use that fact to frame the US.\n\n\nBut that does not mean that their motive was entirely altruistic. They may have been part of the '9/11 conspiracy', in the sense that they may be able to connect the dots within their own government and within their own agency to see what really happened on that very day. But the fact remains that the Bush family is directly responsible for 9/11, their top security advisor may have known nothing about the truth of what happened on September 11, but his fingerprints have been on every aspect of US policy since, so long as he's still involved, including the invasion of Iraq, the destruction of Libya, and our wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria. It has always been Bush's son that ran our government, and he has always been in charge. They were not simply 'paying people' to do the job, which is impossible in a world where 'pay people' means selling the government to big business. It would only be legal if the government sold the public. We'll soon see how successful George Bush really is in pushing his political agenda when he becomes the US leader after the next election, where he can push laws that benefit 'his friends' even as he 'kills people with the bombs'.\n\n\nBut the real reason for 9/11 has nothing to do with 'paying people', and everything to do with the oil industry, the US ruling class, and the world's biggest and most successful corporation...\n\n\nA COUPLE FACTORS PLAYED LIEUTENANTLY IN COMING TO POWER.\n\n(1) Oil is the most profitable industry in the developed world. The US has never recovered from the ravages of our foreign policy of 'liberation' and 'democracy', from its support of Israel during the 'divide and rule' campaign of '99% revolt' with Iraq, to our own neo-liberal agenda of privatization, and the free trade negotiations with other countries. Israel has stolen most of the oil in the area of the Golan, and it has been stealing the oil of Iraq since the 1950s. Iraq was once an oil rich country - after being occupied and under the control of the British Empire, the US and other countries sold their oil.

{"id": 64, "text": "SANDY, Utah – The best thing that could have happened in the two minutes between Salt Lake City's opening goal and its 3-2 win over FC Dallas was what could have happened in those two minutes with Orlando City SC.\n\nAfter Dallas' third-round MLS Cup last season, they made a roster change. They didn't like what they saw and made an effort to trade for attacking midfielder Miguel Ibarra a day before the trade deadline. Ibarra was given a three-year deal worth a total of $6.2 million from Orlando City when Orlando City waived the defender just before the trade deadline and Ibarra was on the open market last month.\n\nThe deal was for $1.9 million with the salary option for year three of the deal. The move was a gamble by Orlando City (30-30-4) who had to hope Ibarra would agree to a change after a poor first season where he was not used on the field. Ibarra played in just 12 games last year after playing 28 last year and is expected as Orlando City's first-choice holding midfield midfielder.\n\nWhat it would have taken for Orlando City to get Ibarra on the field for the entire year would have been the willingness and ability of the club to spend $6.2 million for him.\n\nThat type of trade and Ibarra's inability to make an impact until a month after the move were two big factors for the loss to Salt Lake City on Wednesday.\n\n\"He didn't play at 100 percent or do what we needed him to do,\" Orlando City coach Jason Kreis said after the game. \"We don't have it yet. We have to be in there and get it done.\"\n\nThe move cost the Lions (29-28-7) the midfield depth of Ibarra's predecessor, Jorge Villafana. It was no surprise Orlando City didn't sign Villafana or Ibarra this offseason.\n\n\"It's disappointing, but I think it's fair to say that he won't be a part of our team,\" Orlando City midfielder Tommy Redding said about Villafana in March. \"We thought that we had an agreement that would work.\"\n\nSo why did Orlando City make this move?\n\n\"Obviously we thought, for the right price, that it was a good trade that would keep we going a little bit,\" Orlando City midfielder Cyle Larin said. \"The other part of it, we know his style of play well. That is what we liked seeing, whether it is against us or just playing, or against anybody in midfield, you try as hard as you can not to lose sight of yourself and to try to help your team get as much goal and not get beat in the tackle, or the ball from a play, get set a few steps earlier.\"\n\nIbarra made the right fit\n\nIbarra's ability to win possession of the ball and get it himself makes him a good fit for Kreis' system, which is essentially based on quick, hard-working players who know they need to get the ball into the box.\n\nBut Ibarra's biggest attribute is that when he does get the ball, Ibarra likes to win.\n\nIn the 34 regular season games that Ibarra played for Orlando City last season, he had 10 goals and five assists.\n\nIn the first meeting between the clubs this season, before the trade, Ibarra had two goals and three assists and led the Lions with 551 seconds of possession.\n\nIn the game against Salt Lake City, Ibarra had two goals and no assists.\n\nIbarra's ability to win was on display again Tuesday night in the second half. This time, he won it back to give the Lions a lead.\n\nKreis described that second goal as a \"good corner\" that was caught by the team's back three. But the shot was not a well-weighted ball. It flew past Dallas forward Cristian Higuita for the goal.\n\n\"We got frustrated, we didn't do well on the ball, we gave the ball away, we let the team play its style of play,\" Ibarra said about the goal. \"The second goal is one of those plays, it's one of those ones where we got it wrong, but we took the second goal because we were the better team.\"\n\nWhen he played with Villafana as a rookie last season, Orlando City made a roster change from a 4-4-2 formation to 4-4-2 and Ibarra started there most of the season.\n\nBut he struggled with the ball at times and it took a lot of hard work for him to find his level.\n\n\"I needed to play better, I needed to get my consistency back,\" Ibarra said. \"I was always a ball boy because I was always frustrated.\"\n\nK", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 66, "text": "The world's second-largest port of call for illicit shipments of drugs is in Ukraine, but for now the trade will remain strictly within the boundaries of the nation's borders.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Customs Service (ECS), as of June 2015, over 3.8 million kilograms (6.6 million pounds) of drugs have been seized in Odessa since June 2011, according to a data published in an annual report by the agency. And the agency's vice president told DW that at least 1.3 million of them are \"tied\" to illicit drugs.\n\nThe numbers released by the ECS are not updated and are based on data gathered from local customs offices, reports DW, but they do illustrate the dramatic growth of the Odessa port industry. \"There is a strong demand for drugs in Ukraine, which is driven by the large-scale production of narcotics. However, we have no information about the volume or the total amount of the drug production,\" said the ECS's vice president Sergiy Zarypsova.\n\nAccording to Zarypsova, \"We have seen a significant increase in recent years because of the increase of heroin and cocaine in Odessa and the port city.\"\n\nThe ECS says the growth of the port industry coincides with the rise in heroin production, the rise of drug-dealing gangs and the increasing number of tourists in the city, who demand drugs for recreational purposes.\n\nThe situation is particularly tense in the port city, whose residents are still feeling the effects of the 2014 war in Ukraine and a heavy security presence on the Ukrainian frontier.\n\nThe report noted that the city's drug trade is not only a local industry. \"According to the ECS, the growth of drug-dealing gangs is closely associated with the illegal smuggling of drugs and drugs themselves.\"\n\nIn Odessa, authorities are making an effort to ensure the legal market for drugs. According to the ECS, more than 3,500 shops have been built in Odessa last year and that more than 500 more will be built in 2016, bringing the total number of shops up to 8,000. This year, Odessa expects to attract more than 30 million tourists.\n\n\nNo one is safe\n\nIn its first assessment of the country's drug problem, a recent study by the ECS found that the city of Odessa now accounts for about 8 percent of the total drug market in Ukraine in 2015.\n\nThe report stated that about 30 kilograms of drugs were seized in Odessa in 2012, but that that figure rose to 35 kilograms in 2013. \"Of these, more than 50 of them were drugs such as crystal meth, cocaine hydrochloride (cocaine hydrochloride), and marijuana,\" according to the report.\n\n\nOne of the things that makes the Odessa port an attractive destination is precisely the fact that it is well protected. According to the report, two police stations are located in the city, one with a prison in the city's outskirts. The ECS does not believe that criminals in the city are planning to attack tourists who come here. However, the country's border security remains a very sensitive topic for the Ukrainian authorities.\n\n\"The ECS doesn't offer any analysis on the possible impact of the increased security activities on the drug trade,\" Zarypsova said.\n\n\nAccording to the report, in 2013, the number of people employed by the state on the port of Odessa rose to 2,000. Since then, the population has nearly doubled to 2.4 million people. That's the second-largest city outside of Kiev in the country.\n\nOne of the main factors driving the economic boom that has propelled Odessa into one of the biggest drug processing centers in the region is the city's proximity to the Russian border. This allows the city to sell its goods to nearby Russia easily and to avoid paying import taxes.\n\nThe ECS thinks that Odessa is being used by international drug markets, which is \"suspected\" due to the lack of international law enforcement presence in the Ukrainian port.\n\nAt the moment, no one is safe\n\nThe city of Odessa is also a major logistics center for the smuggling of drugs. According to the report, since 2013 about 1.2 million kilograms of cocaine and 1.5 million kg of heroin have been shipped here. According to a recent study by the ECS, almost 100 percent of the heroin in Odessa is supplied by neighboring Russia.\n\nBut while the number of customs officers is always increasing and the trade in narcotics is only growing larger, no one is safe in Odessa.", "length": 950, "ended": true}

Schefter also revealed that the Patriots were in fact allowed to go to Houston to pick up a second-round talent in Tarell Brown who they took in that 2012 draft.\n\nBrown was traded to Jacksonville the next season, where he spent the year on injured reserve while recovering from an ACL tear. With both Brown and Brown gone, the Patriots will have to figure out a way to replace them on the roster.\n\n\"From how it was reported yesterday, I didn't know that the Patriots would be getting Brown or that they would be allowed to go there,\" an AFC personnel executive told The Athletic. \"I'm not sure that's what was intended, but that's the way it fell. And I just don't know how that happened.\"\n\nBrown's departure was only the most visible piece of the puzzle to explain the Patriots' quick shift from being on the outside looking in to the favored opponent now set to be the AFC South in Week 12.\n\nAfter losing starting cornerback Malcolm Butler to a season-ending back injury on Wednesday, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick took a number of unexpected and seemingly out-of-the-blue measures in the early going of the season.\n\nAfter trading a pair of defensive tackles, the Patriots moved a defensive lineman who had started all 17 games of last season—Tarell Brown—to right tackle along with the veteran Will Svitek who was expected to compete with Logan Mankins for the starting spot vacated by Butler.\n\nIn all this, the Patriots, who were set at nose tackle for the entire final 13 games of 2012, took a decidedly different approach in week one against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\"In week one, we were just trying to get it organized and getting everything ready, to come in and work with our new starting nose tackle,\" Belichick said in his weekly radio appearance ahead of the Texans-Patriots game. \"We were going to start Mike Daniels who was a starter [at center], and then Tarell Brown, who had played the entire offseason. We got it all organized, we figured out exactly what we could and couldn't do with the three of us. By game day, we started looking at each other and saying, `Who would be best at these three things? Who's done both before?' We felt like that was a little bit of a challenge.\"\n\nThis strategy of creating a competition within the nose tackle spot wasn't as apparent as it can be when trying to win a game without having the whole unit ready in the first place.\n\nThe Patriots were already set at nose tackle to begin with, having used their first two picks on tackles Austin Howard and Chandler Jones. At one point, Jones was the only thing even resembling a viable viable starting option at the position with Howard having been the only one to have any consistency in the preseason to get any real playing time.\n\nIn their early two games, however, the Patriots had to scramble to get Jones the playing time he needed to contribute. In the Texans game, Jones started at right tackle—as the starting nose tackle.\n\n\"Our goal is to make sure that all four of us are as prepared that we can play in the game, and that's why those three guys came in,\" Belichick said. \"It's more about getting that competition going instead of trying to make it all go in on one guy. We wanted to start that competition and have those three guys be ready to play. We've done this a couple of times the last two weeks and we did it again with Tarell Brown.\"\n\nIt's not a stretch to say that the Patriots were not prepared to start anyone at left tackle. Instead, they got Howard and Jones in their place from the start, putting them up against each other during their first few series.\n\nAnd they did everything else right before, during, and after the game.\n\n\"Tarell Brown was very good, but Mike Daniels wasn't great, and in the last week they got him to the point where he was doing a nice job,\" said our AFC personnel executive. \"He's not a great playmaker or a great run blocker, but he's got a good chance to come in and play some good football. And Logan Mankins is a pretty good player. I think this was a combination of them. It's not like there was one guy and they went out and got two of them.

It was a unique experience.\n\nIf you saw them, you would go: How did they get to be so smart? How did North Korea do it? How did they keep a nuclear bomb in the country? There's a few stories from the people that went through a tour because it wasn't as busy as you would think it would be. All it was like was a museum. They would tell us stories. They would tell us about themselves and then they would walk in a different direction. At one point they would walk into their hotel room to the bathroom, which was not even part of the hotel. They wouldn't just go in their room. They walked in the opposite direction. It was so odd, because we would see these huge crowds from all over the world at these huge sports tournaments. I saw the North Koreans at one of these games, and I was like: What? It's not like I can just go into the bathroom and shower or anything.\n\nThey'd just walk in their room. They had the same toilet as everyone else, but they have a little toilet. They didn't have a bathroom like we had every night to just use. They had toilets that were about the size of someone's hand, and the bathroom had a shower as well. Then they'd just take their stuff out of their room, and they would take it in and then they'd take it out again until they had everything and then they'd go out. Then they'd go back in.\n\nThe rest of the tourists were just a bunch of Americans who went to South Korea and they went through the customs there. They all just go through the same thing. They had everything they wanted except the toilet because they didn't have something like that. They didn't know how to use it.\n\nWhen they'd come in, I would tell them and I'd make them laugh, and I'd say, \"These are our people. These are this nation.\" Then I'd say, \"Do you have your country back? This is your people.\" And it would make them feel they're not forgotten.\n\nSometimes they would say, \"Oh, it's okay we didn't know I could go so far to get away!\" They were so happy and so happy to be back. It showed that they were able to get back their country. That was a real feeling. I have heard that they say, \"We can't really be sure they can come back, but we're happy we got away from the totalitarian country.\" What's happening now, they don't want to live in a prison. They want to be able to go out. They want to go work or travel through China or South Korea or Japan. They want to go to a place that doesn't have any kind of tyranny. But, because of Dennis Rodman, it's like they can't say no anymore. And if they don't like it, they don't want to live in North Korea. They say, \"I'll be back.\"\n\n[North Korea is not the same North Korea in 2003. Kim Jong Il has survived. He has the nuclear bomb. He has the ability to launch missiles. But what we are seeing and what we know about the people who lived through [his] three-year rule will forever change North Korea.]\n\nThere was, and still is, a huge misunderstanding of the culture in North Korea. People want to feel like they have more freedom.\n\n", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 73, "text": "The FBI today released their report on the Benghazi investigation, highlighting a series of failures that led to Hillary Clinton being placed on \"special detail\" in 2014 shortly before the attack.\n\nHere are 6 major problems with the report which will shock you and disgust you.\n\nThe FBI report notes they found:\n\nFBI investigations identified Clinton confidante Sidney Blumenthal as the \"eminent figure\" in an effort by the State Department to protect Hillary Clinton from responsibility for security failures during the terrorist attack. According to the report, Clinton confidante Sidney Blumenthal was given a security clearance to travel to Benghazi in a personal capacity in 2014. The FBI investigation found that Blumenthal frequently exchanged e-mails about Libya with senior State Department officials between February 2011 and early December 2014, during the time she was advising then-Secretary of State Clinton on Libya policy. The e-mails show that Blumenthal spoke with officials about security issues at the mission, including the presence of Islamist militants loyal to former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the compound. The New York Times subsequently reported that Blumenthal discussed the threat of Islamist militants with senior State Department officials, such as John Kirby and Victoria Nuland.\n\nThey also found that, after the attack was over, Blumenthal kept in touch with Clinton's top aides, including Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan.\n\nThey said:\n\nFBI investigations also found that Clinton's personal e-mail server was extensively monitored by U.S. government agencies – from the Federal Bureau of Investigations to the National Security Agency. The FBI report concluded that a U.S. government employee with knowledge of the monitoring had access to the server and that the monitoring, which occurred from March 2012 through September 2012, interfered with the security team's ability to respond appropriately.\n\nTheir report also uncovered that the State Department's Accountability Review Board (ARB) did not adequately investigate the Benghazi attacks.\n\nThe ARB also concluded that \"there is a reasonable possibility\" that a \"felon\" – as the FBI term is – could have had access to Clinton's server.\n\nFBI investigators found a further problem with the Department of State – after Clinton left office – that the investigation failed to include other key Benghazi witnesses that could have clarified the events at the mission – including former CIA officer John Guandique.\n\nTheir report stated:\n\nThe FBI investigation found that, after Secretary Clinton's departure from office, it was unknown who retained the private server she used while she was serving as Secretary of State or who had access to her e-mail during her six years in office. Further, at the time of Secretary Clinton's departure from office, it was unknown whether John Guandique retained the server as Secretary of State's personal computer, or whether the server was re­configured by the State Department as a server for a non-Department system. Neither the ARB – nor the Department Security Archive – knew who retained the server or who had the server until months later when the ARB began its own investigation.\n\nOn the matter of whether a U.S. government employee could have had access to Clinton's server, the FBI wrote:\n\nA review of the State Department's computer network revealed that, in addition to State workers, two unnamed State Department employees had administrative access to the clintonemail.com server during Mrs. Clinton's tenure. Both individuals were assigned by Secretary Clinton to offices in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Both of these individuals, who neither possessed nor had any legitimate need to possess an SCI [self‑contained i.e., Internet-connected] system to monitor the Secretary's email, could not have accessed or reviewed Clinton's emails from her private server. The FBI and State discovered this after examining a wide array of State Department technology products and processes.\n\nThe FBI also revealed that, for all the information they found on Clinton's server, they did not find any information that had personally identified Hillary Clinton.\n\nTheir report noted:\n\nWe examined all of Secretary Clinton's e-mails sent or received from April 21, 2009 through January 30, 2014 and did not find any information that would identify her as the sender or recipient of any of the e‑mails. In addition, we found no other e‑mails that include a header that identifies the sender or recipient.\n\nThe report states:\n\nAdditionally, a review of publicly available information from the State Department revealed no e‑mails from or to Secretary Clinton containing information that is classified at the Secret level. The FBI did, however, find two e‑mails sent or received by Secretary Clinton that were determined to contain Top Secret information at the Secret Level. One of these e‑mails was forwarded to the former Chief of Staff of the Department and contained a classified national security information when forwarded to the Secretary. The FBI also found two other e‑mails directly related to Secretary Clinton's personal e- mail account that were determined to contain Department or State business when sent to or from her personal account.

{"id": 77, "text": "\nLast month, the American Civil Liberties Union unveiled a new tool to track data collection by the government and monitor communications and actions by U.S. citizens who use the Internet without a warrant. Called an Open Intercept, the tool shows when the U.S. government collects information from private sources, including emails, phone calls and searches of social media.\n\nThe data show that the NSA collects information on every email and Internet connection, with more than 2 billion being collected in 2010. It is estimated that in 2011, the agency is collecting metadata on Americans using only a few private services. By comparison, the NSA is only collecting metadata on foreigners to a much smaller scale.\n\nBut the NSA also has a far larger database, called PRISM. This database enables the NSA to harvest email content from Google, as well as many other online communications.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the ACLU report is its analysis of the data. Using technology developed by the non-profit Open Technology Institute, it produced a series of detailed analysis of the data collected by the NSA. The analysis also breaks down the data into categories, such as search terms, sender identity and IP addresses, to explore what the government is able to collect.\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Post, Peter Swire, the executive director of the ACLU, said:\n\nWe are pleased with the ACLU's analysis of government data collection under the NSA surveillance program. In doing so, we have seen how the government collects and distributes information about Americans' most closely held personal and private communications. We are encouraged by the fact that the ACLU's analysis highlights the need for the U.S. government to do more to protect the privacy of American citizens and highlight its willingness to engage in a transparent process to provide information about the data collected about American citizens.\n\nThe report also reveals:\n\nThe government has a way in which it can monitor communications in real-time, even if there is no court order to do so. In response to a March 3, 2012, story on The Guardian newspaper, a senior intelligence official said that \"the US government is able to monitor the international communications of Americans without a court order by searching directly into the contents of their emails.\" The official went on to say that \"the vast majority of these intercepts involve foreign communications. If the purpose of an intercept is to facilitate foreign intelligence, NSA may not be required to use Section 702.\"\n\nUnder the NSA's Section 702 program, the government has previously claimed in public that it only collects information \"relevant\" to foreign intelligence but never used the program to collect information of Americans. The New York Times reported on September 24 that the NSA has also used the program to target American-born Muslims as terrorists.\n\nIn October, it was revealed that the United States government was secretly using an experimental program (known as SHAMROCK) to acquire communications under a secret warrant. SHAMROCK, which began in 2010, was designed to help the FBI locate an individual who was using an encrypted communication service and then attempt to break the encryption.\n\nThe new report is only the beginning, Swire told the Post.\n\n\"The report was just a snapshot of what the government can use to track the movements of its citizens,\" Swire said. \"It doesn't tell the full story, and we are encouraged that other organizations, including the New York Times, have continued this reporting over the past five months. The report has been released and the ACLU welcomes more reporting.\"\n\nA White House official spoke with New York Times to confirm the report. \"This is just the beginning and we welcome these independent efforts,\" the official added, \"and have encouraged others to do likewise.\"", "length": 758, "ended": true}
{"id": 78, "text": "By\n\nWith a little over 1 year to go on the Kickstarter project for the sequel to The Last Of Us, Naughty Dog fans are starting to really dig the teaser trailer we released a little while ago. But there's two big issues preventing us from making any final preparations:\n\n\n- Naughty Dog wants to make the trailer last forever so that people would know how amazing the game is and not just to look at a few frames and then move on.\n\n\n- We feel that there is some kind of delay between when we started work on the trailer and when it's made available to the public. This means that people who have supported their game and put more time and effort into the game can't get something for free.\n\n\nWe appreciate everyone who has supported their game to reach its Kickstarter goal and look forward to unveiling the game to you guys.\n\n\nWe also thank the people who pledged to our Kickstarter for a number of awesome items that will be included in The Last Of Us 2, and would like to thank you for the support in The Last Of Us 1, too.\n\nA large portion of Naughty Dog's success has stemmed from the success of The Last Of Us. Although many gamers will claim that the sequel is not up to snuff when compared to the original, those who have played the original are hard to ignore. The Last Of Us is considered by many to be one of the most underrated video game story-driven experiences around. It's a simple but powerful tale of perseverance, sacrifice, and determination on the eve of a world-destroying apocalypse. The plot for the game is incredibly intricate, with Joel, Ellie, and the others having their own personal struggles and tragedies. We're now at the point where we're excited to reveal some of the other characters we'll be exploring as part of The Last Of Us 2.\n\n\nFirst off, we've got the aforementioned Joel, who is now married and has a daughter. It's been years since that fateful visit with the dead, and Ellie never forgets her past, despite her father's attempts to bury her. She'll try to get by with just a day job; though the night shifts may seem to be what Joel's mother would have wanted, we think this might just be her first step toward full and meaningful independence.\n\n\nAnother character whose past has been largely forgotten is Sarah – but we're going to show you her new life in our current video!\n\n\nAs for our other big DLC addition, The Last Of Us 2 will feature new weapons to use, and a new character, which we haven't yet named. While in the first game, the majority of weapons used by The Last Of Us protagonist Joel were obtained during his mission to rescue Ellie and Ellie herself, The Last Of Us 2 will feature new weapons for all characters, both from The Last Of Us, and the original. The last thing you should be seeing in the trailer is the return of the infamous \"The Chained Coffin\" trophy. It's been a long time since we've seen one of these, so it seems like the best thing to do, at least in our short video, is to wait for the final reveal for it!", "length": 653, "ended": true}
{"id": 79, "text": "I'm still sitting here trying to process all that I've learned through this past week. The first thing I want to do is explain how this happened, what kind of impact it has on me, and how I have resolved my concerns.\n\nFirst, let's review what occurred. During a game of the \"Funny Farm\" game, I was being pressured by two of my friends to choose one of a pair of shoes to put on my head. I immediately took a pair of black and white tennis shoes. The shoes are actually a pair of blue and white striped tennis shoes that I have worn to games for years, and even then, there was no pressure to choose. However, due to an oversight on their part, one of my teammates wanted to pick a pair of purple dress shoes instead.\n\nMy friend didn't know which shoes I was wearing at all, and was confused when I told him that I was \"picking the shoes with the ball.\"\n\nMy coach had the power to disqualify the teammate from the game if it was apparent that one of the shoes was a gift or gift wrap, or if the player was wearing a gift. However, my coach decided not to do this.\n\nI was frustrated.\n\nHow does this even work?\n\nIt's common for basketball coaches to give players gifts, but this is completely abnormal.\n\nHow do I not feel the pressure?\n\nI will not feel the pressure! No basketball player should feel the pressure from my coach unless those players are actively attempting to do it. If they aren't intentionally trying to do it, it is acceptable, and I believe this is why coaches often pick a specific pair of shoes that they have, in my eyes, already used.\n\nI will do a little experiment. What would happen if players could actually choose their own gift? There are a couple of ways I have chosen to address this:\n\nFirst, I did go to a gift store and picked some of their basketball socks to give out to my teammates, or wear out on the court. Most people did not like the socks. My teammates loved them. They wore them to practice, and they loved them that they had something to wear in practice instead of being forced to wear socks that looked ugly.\n\nThese socks were so good they actually made me feel a little better about picking out socks when it is their teammate's birthday. A friend of mine got them for her birthday last week. No one knew the other player's birthday was coming up, but everyone was a little excited to see her gift.\n\nIt's fine to be upset about a teammate being forced to wear something inappropriate and unnecessary. However, if it isn't intentionally trying to look ugly, which many believe it was, then why punish the player? I don't recall my coach telling me that I shouldn't have picked my player's gift, but I don't remember my coach saying anything to say any better about the pair of socks.\n\nI won't feel pressure to pick my friend's gift over that of my teammate's either. I didn't pick my roommate's, nor did I pick my girlfriend's, but I'm not a terrible person, nor am I the type to be afraid of a stranger making a decision based on a gift.\n\nSecond, if I actually felt the pressure at any point in the game, I would say something to my coach about it at the beginning of the game. We talked a lot about this after the fact. Then, of course, I would try my best to be an adult. I asked my friend to come back to the court if she needed to buy another pair of shoes, and that she could take the pairs home if she wasn't too upset. She did that, I gave a brief explanation of why I felt that way, and we just went out for a few minutes.\n\nThis is also unacceptable. In a competitive game, I would expect my coach to make sure my teammates' wishes are honored.\n\nWhat do I look for in a friend's gifts?\n\nHow do I avoid becoming overly pressured in situations like this? One way that I feel confident in my ability to tell my coach what I feel is a genuine apology or even a small \"sorry about this\" is if it is a pair of shoes that I am willing to wear on the court without pressure, or is there is no pressure. The choice whether to pick this gift or that gift should not necessarily come down to what is good for my teammate. In the end, I think that whether you don't feel pressured because it's not blatantly inappropriate or because I think that it is, your desire and effort to ensure my friendship is important.\n\nI can't help wondering at this point what the coach was trying to accomplish here, by giving my teammate the gift she wanted. It seemed like he put the cart before the horse, as far as he was concerned.\n\nI know it may only be the first thing to ever happen in", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

It would also require countries and states to adopt rules, in some cases setting more of a minimum age for entry to school, work, or medical treatment.\n\nThe United States, Russia, and several of the other signatories to the treaty were slow to respond to an initial draft published in February 2015, the human rights group said.\n\n\"The United States' slow response to this groundbreaking treaty has been remarkable,\" said Bill Piper, executive director of Human Rights Watch. \"The United States should be leading by example. The current U.S. administration should be commending its treaty partners for their leadership in addressing this global issue.\"\n\nSome of the countries that were slow to act had been \"deeply conflicted about having any treaty at all,\" Piper said. \"It may not be obvious to U.S. policymakers, but they are taking part in the global fight against children's rights and are ultimately responsible for protecting the child.\"\n\nAmong the changes in the final text of the treaty are requiring an 18-year-old man to work from home at least 30 hours a week and allowing a minimum of six hours education for school-age children by 2017, according to the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nThe draft would change the definition of sexual abuse of children to include forced marriages but it would allow countries to maintain the existing definition of sexual abuse.\n\nThe draft would require an 18-year-old man to work from home at least 30 hours a week and allow a minimum of six hours education for school-age children by 2017, according to the Human Rights Watch report. (UNICEF)\n\n\"We need a long-term commitment to the human rights of children. If the Obama administration, particularly Secretary Clinton, does not put its thumb on the scale in the next U.S.-U.N. summit meeting, other nations will take the lead.\" The human rights group's report was issued during a visit to the U.N. headquarters in New York City. At the summit in January 2015, Clinton called for the treaty.\n\nThe treaty, which calls for the right of everyone to equal opportunity and respect for the inherent dignity of every Human, would also require states to guarantee access to education for children. The treaty would require every state to establish a national strategy to advance gender equity in schooling. It also calls for measures to protect the rights of women and girls in countries experiencing violence in conflicts, and for improved policies and systems to enable girls to access education and healthcare.\n\nIn addition, the treaty would encourage countries to consider the issue of child marriages among the child protection situations that need to be addressed.\n\nThe treaty would require every state to establish a national strategy to advance gender equity in schooling.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also warned that if the United Nations does not pass the treaty before the end of 2016, countries will likely be reluctant to ratify it because the United States is not \"very serious about implementing the treaty.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch believes that only the United States is likely to move ahead on the treaty unless a new U.S. administration adopts an affirmative commitment to improving the plight of children, Piper said.\n\n\"The U.S. government is likely to take advantage of its leverage with China, Russia, and other countries involved in the negotiations to ensure that the treaty is adopted this year without the United States or China and Russia voting against,\" Piper said. \"With so many countries participating, some countries will probably vote against the treaty if it is not ratified in the next few sessions with no new U.S. administration.\"\n\nThe treaty would also make it harder for countries to deny access to abortion, Piper said. \"It would also have a chilling effect on efforts to pass laws related to sexual activity while minors, although there are exceptions for rape or incest, with the same punishment as if the perpetrator had intercourse with the victim when she was 15 or younger. Such a law would also prohibit certain forms of male circumcision without the consent of parental consent for religious purposes.\"\n\nThe final text includes a \"special exception\" for women facing domestic violence or sexual assault.\n\nIt would require states to \"ensure that no child under the age of 18 is recruited, trained, or employed at a private institution that engages in forced labor or sex slavery or trafficking, or is forced to perform forced labor or sex slavery or trafficking, including by a family member, parent, or relative, or someone acting acting for or on behalf of such a person.\"", "length": 984, "ended": true}

{"id": 82, "text": "On February 23 and 24, 2016, two of the world's most famous chefs, Peter Chang and Danny Meyer, sat down for a discussion with the New York Times.\n\nPeter Chang has been one of America's most successful chefs because of his commitment to small-batch ingredients. His approach has brought about the rise of \"New American Cuisine\": low-cost, artisanal food grown mostly on rooftop farms and hand-fertilized on street corners. A New York Times article from 2011 called Chang's cooking \"America's first foodie restaurant.\" Last year, a restaurant called The White House was open, selling the same cheap, fresh dishes Chang used to serve.\n\nDanny Meyer's approach is a little older. Meyer grew up in the Midwestern Midwest, ate a lot of Chinese food, and was educated in China. The food he makes at home, Meyer says, is much more than Chinese food. This focus has turned him into a pioneer in the craft of \"grilling,\" where the grill is the star player. To his credit, Meyer has turned the concept, which was the province of traditional Chinese cooks, from an artisanal food into consumer-friendly fare—in a way many people never even knew existed. The same goes for the \"grilled cheese\" dish—it's something Meyer's mom would make for her family for more than three decades.\n\nBoth these chefs are smart, innovative, and driven. They both grew up in Midwestern and Eastern cultures. Both are also passionate about food. And both realize that many of their customers are young adults between the ages of 20 and 35, which is the demographic most ready to embrace new food trends.\n\nAs I've noted before, food trends in and of themselves can be confusing. When it comes to Chinese takeout, for example, all you've heard is, \"It's not easy being green in China.\" The truth is that it is a lot easier, and more cost-effective for Chinese companies to source foods from Asian markets. And if you're like the rest of us, it's worth the gamble. I personally think those two factors are what make the market so exciting and exciting. They've been right, and I think others—especially young people—know this too.\n\n\"Crave\" in particular has a new chapter with the introduction of China Unicom, an emerging food giant that will eventually be the biggest food services provider in China. To be clear, China Unicom is not going to revolutionize Chinese food. They won't have a single dish that has ever attracted more than five million visitors to a single restaurant, nor will they be the one to replace the venerable KFC. While they may look similar, the real difference between China Unicom and KFC is the fact that they aren't based in Korea. China Unicom is based in Shanghai, and its flagship restaurants are set in China.\n\nChina Unicom has made a name for itself by using the best equipment, making the most of local resources, and providing the biggest bang for the buck, to ensure that meals are delicious and efficient while still remaining true to the authentic taste and taste of Chinese culture. While I think the restaurants can be delicious and efficient even in their smaller sizes, the real difference between Beijing (the big one) and Shanghai (the little one) is the quality and amount of service. At restaurants like these, you don't have to wait for four people to sit down at the same time while the food is going to be prepared and cooked. You can just see what's going to happen in the next ten minutes—you can feel the quality of the food coming right up to your table. (I once waited in line for 40 minutes to see a good meal at Shanghai Lotte—I love to wait!)\n\nSo that's what I'm proposing in Crave. My vision here is to change the way we talk about cuisines on television or in magazines, to bring greater emphasis to the local and the authentic, to take care to treat the ingredients and the people who work to make them as well as the food itself, to make sure that all of the cooks and servers and bartenders and servers at the best restaurants know who they're dealing with and care about them and are working really hard as well as our readers. The goal here has to be to not feel like we are reading one thing a magazine said and then another thing from another magazine. Instead we're reading the dishes that they serve. So instead of looking for one \"authentic\" restaurant when that restaurant has just opened, we should be looking to five or even ten places who are serving similar dishes and have the same kinds of staff and the same techniques. These dishes are what they are, not what an Italian restaurant tells you a restaurant should be.\n\nI don't want to diminish the importance of the big, national chains. They're good and important, if you love them as much as I do. I'm just saying that they're not going to do", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 83, "text": "The European Union has been trying to find a way to stop companies from using digital patents to block their competitors from profiting from their ideas. But it's still not clear how much that's working. In the weeks since German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed legislation that would make it easier for companies to block competitors, companies such as Microsoft's Skype and Google's YouTube have gone on the offensive, saying they are the victims of a \"dramatic\" government overreach.\n\nWhile the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been urging lawmakers to block such measures, European companies who want to protect their intellectual property have been more aggressive.\n\nIn Europe, patent holders have threatened to block or slow down innovation in the online space if they don't get their way. They argue that Europe's patent system gives them too much control over how products are developed, or could put them at a disadvantage when making sales overseas.\n\n\"There is no reason in the world to support this,\" said Eric Hedin, an executive at mobile phone company Nokia Oyj. \"They say that they are only worried about anti-trust,\" while they do little to stop foreign companies from taking market share in Europe.\n\nThe stakes are high for European companies. European tech companies account for 40 percent of the global smartphone market and 80 percent of the data center revenue in Europe. But many of these companies are looking to move their manufacturing operations to the United States, and there are fears that if they don't move to America, the European companies could suffer if they go where competitors already exist.\n\nIn the first two years of 2014, Europe generated $60 billion in sales from its high-tech industries, according to IHS Technology, but just $26 billion of that came from the U.S.\n\n\"If Europe goes in the direction where I don't think it's doing a good thing for Europe, I really think it will have far greater consequences for the digital economy in Europe,\" said Chris Voss, head of European telecom policy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an think tank in Washington. He described the \"dramatic\" government takeover as \"an attack on innovation here at home and in the EU.\"\n\nU.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, who was part of the tech industry in pushing for the U.K. to join the United States in opening up the European market to Chinese mobile phone maker Huawei, said the government takeover \"is an attempt to take all the power away from the U.K. companies.\"\n\nMerkel says it's about fighting for European industries. But in practice the government and companies have tended to ignore the issue.\n\n\"The companies have done all they could to try and stifle competition,\" Merkel said in a speech in Berlin last week. But because they haven't been able to stop it entirely, \"they haven't really had the power they would have needed.\"\n\nSo there is not much Germany can do to force companies that export goods from Europe's largest economy to change the way they do business here. That could be one reason why so much of the U.S. business community has jumped on the anti-European sentiment on the part of big companies and has been pushing for the \"transparency\" measures announced by Merkel in April.\n\nBut the government has been getting some support from Europe's larger companies. The European Commission and the European Parliament want to require companies to publish their data transfers within 30 days, just as they do with products.\n\nEuropean companies have been pushing for a so-called \"circular economy\" in which all countries get a share of the benefits of products or services produced in countries like the U.S. and China but that those benefits are passed around to all parties in a \"bilateral\" way. In a circular economy, companies can be forced to give all of that data to a company or government that owns it.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Andrus Ansip said his agency in 2014 proposed a similar measure, which has recently been backed by the European Parliament and the commission.\n\n\"So we are working on this. It's not finished. It remains a proposal. But with the recent developments, we're quite confident that it will be adopted within about two years. And that's when you can start thinking about the possibility of circularization,\" Agip said this month.\n\n\"Circularization\" in action\n\nTo implement a circular economy, companies would have to first have to change their business practices. And that's not exactly how things go: In the past, companies often have said nothing about the nature of their business activities. Companies say they are not allowed to discuss their data-transfer practices with any authority.\n\n\"It wouldn't take too much to start having some conversation about it,\" said Jonathan Schilling, an American entrepreneur living in Germany. \"I can imagine a conversation with the companies that manufacture my products and we could discuss the transfers.

The authors, both American, note the lack of any English translation of the writings of this revolutionary movement. The resulting book is a fascinating exploration on the history of modern feminism from its beginnings to its final demise.\n\nThis collection is a wonderful piece of labor history to add to any Marxist reader's repertoire. The authors note the lack of a proper translation of the first half of a book on the \"history of sexual oppression of women.\" While the first half of this book details the \"history of the emancipation of women\" by means of women's participation in the labour movement and civil rights, the second half discusses the history of contemporary feminism as \"a movement for equality between men and women\" whose core \"sides include a commitment to women's equal status in the workplace and with the state,\" the eradication of women's subordination and the establishment of women's rights.\n\nThe book comes at a good time, as the world is experiencing a shift in terms of gender roles and the impact it will have both on individual and society. For example, the \"Women's March on Washington\" was organized on Jan. 21, the day before President Trump was inaugurated.\n\nFor this reason, the authors point out that today a \"very strong case\" is being made in the academic literature that the birth of feminism — in particular, the emancipation of women — was an important watershed in shaping modern feminism.\n\n\"There have been some important feminist thinkers who were instrumental in helping to make the transition,\" said the authors and \"they have been very influential. And that is not a bad thing either. We can thank these people for opening up a whole new world of social theory and social theory can have a very important influence on the culture and on human history.\"\n\nThe book's authors note that the \"main thrust of the emancipating force behind the emergence of modern feminism was the concept of women's equality with men.\"\n\n\"This idea is a central premise of women's equality, both with men and within the community,\" they write. \"Its recognition was crucial to achieving the goal of 'women's liberation.'\"\n\nWhile this \"equality\" was indeed achieved, the \"gender-neutral concepts of women's equality were introduced in the 19th century as a result of developments outside the sphere of women's liberation.\"\n\nIndeed, it was the social development of women's status that began in much of Europe following the Middle Ages, and was later influenced by the Enlightenment.\n\nThe authors note the development of modern capitalism as a result of this \"modernization.\"\n\n\"Social relations within capitalism also tend to make women less equal than men,\" they say.\n\nWhile it was important for the emancipation of women to develop a theory and practice of \"women's equality,\" the authors cite the efforts of feminist intellectuals to do this \"on their own\" and make the world a better place for women.\n\n\"This effort was not limited to women's rights activists; women's historians and feminists of all stripes were very important contributors,\" they note.\n\nMany feminist thinkers were the founders of socialist or feminist theories. As a result, the \"feminist movement in many respects began as a counterweight to Marxism.\" According to the authors, the women's movement helped bring women \"to power\" in many countries and \"provided a framework for the development of capitalist political economies in the period of the nineteenth century.\"\n\n\"But feminist theory at the time of the First World War was in reality an ideological tool for the class struggle,\" they note. This \"in fact, led to the suppression of the movement to the extent the movement itself could not overcome political repression.\"\n\nThe book concludes with a very brief discussion of its authors' own research on the subject.\n\n\"With the publication of these essays a new and vibrant history of feminism has emerged,\" they conclude.\n\nThe book is a marvelous read. It is easy to follow even in plain English and is a delight to read once in a while.

Researchers were interested in examining whether the number of weapons recovered influenced crime by comparing it to crime rates.\n\nSpecifically, the Texas Crime Data Center (TCDC) analyzed handgun crimes per 1,000 people through July 2012 in every county in the U.S.\n\nTCDC found that crime increased with the number of guns recovered, with a 10th of a percent increase in violence associated with gun-toting suspects in a gun-tied car accident. This indicates that more guns mean less risk.\n\nThe researchers studied gun-possession crime rates in each county, which are estimated to be approximately 300,000 per year. In this study, a gun-tied car accident was defined as a driver's car being locked in a vehicle during a crime with three or more suspects and the victim had a firearm stolen from the car. Because of the relatively low rate of firearm crime as a means to determine the number of victims of gun-related crime in cars, the study relied on county-level crime data that were more precise at the county level.\n\nIn analyzing crime rates per 1,000 guns recovered, TCDC also noted that the data do not adequately reflect violent gun possession and crimes from private residence. As a result, these violent crimes are often not recorded.\n\n\"We know that a large number of guns are recovered each year — some of which are used in crime,\" said Steven R.

{"id": 90, "text": "The first two seasons of Orange Is the New Black have been the best of the Netflix originals, and that's probably because it's the rare TV show that works outside of its original setting. The two seasons, and most of the first season, are set inside of a series of cells that are in constant flux due to the prison system's attempt to create a model model of community and justice based on a model of control. In many ways, this is a perfect representation of the world we live in today: a chaotic and often chaotic world of social control under the illusion of human decency and justice through a prison system built with prisons in mind.\n\nOrange is actually the second season's biggest story, focusing on Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling) and the fact that she's serving a sentence for selling drugs to a prison inmate who was sent to her by the government. This is the story about what it means to be a prisoner inside of a prison, and as with the show's other characters, Piper's motivations drive the narrative right back to prison and social control. There are no flashbacks, no flashbacks to her prison-sentence, and it's all about her time inside the prison. At the height of prison riots, Piper and other characters experience flashbacks to all the things that happened in their time at the prison, often by looking back to the time they were imprisoned and the decisions they made. While many of the flashbacks and conversations are important and thought-provoking, some of them feel like repetitions of the same themes and events that happen in other shows. Some of these discussions feel like they serve the story of Orange, and some felt more like filler, especially when it comes to Piper's relationship with Sophia Burset (Keri Russell) and her past convictions.\n\nThe show's final season is less episodic in nature and more about the themes of social control and accountability in a world where our political leaders continue to be unresponsive. I love that season, and the characters it highlights, but I wish they were more focused on the bigger picture. There were a few moments this season that were very moving and powerful, but I felt like they felt like they had too many moments of a character reliving the past and wondering what it'd be like again. I'm hoping that season three is like season two was, but I feel that if they wanted to continue telling this story, they'd focus on the real themes and issues.\n\nThe new season, however, is really set in the present day, and that's because after Piper's first stint inside of Litchfield, she's given a chance to go home. For most of the episode, Piper has no friends or acquaintances she could talk to in jail. When she finally gets a small slice of home life, it's with a fellow inmate named Mike (Seth Gilliam) and fellow ex-con, Nick (Jonathan Banks). While everyone in Litchfield is under the suspicion of having some criminal past, Mike still has his good side. He's also a former inmate who got out and has been able to take back some of the trust he put in Piper to help him. They have this really interesting dynamic, not just because it's the first time we see Mike in prison, but also because he's the first person we've seen in almost two seasons that we can expect to see in the future: a parolee.\n\nIn the second half of Season Three, Mike and Nick are trying to make their way on parole. This is because Piper is now in a new cell where she's been incarcerated and she won't be spending the night anymore when she comes home for Christmas. With all the tensions and conflict that Piper's experience has caused, I expected something like a reunion between the two people in the first place. Instead, it seemed like they weren't sure if they'd get on their feet again with each other. So I was a little disappointed by how much of Piper's story ended up being about Mike, Nick and their newfound freedom. As far as the show went off on its own, that was unfortunate. Although the show had a lot of moments that touched on issues with prison and prison politics, most of them were really focused on the main characters.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Orange Is The New Black last season. While there are some frustrating moments here and there, the main storyline and characters were well fleshed out, and I loved their interactions. The show continued to put its stamp on what it means to be incarcerated and what it means to become a different kind of person within it all.

That session was not very friendly to the speaker, either.\n\nIt was there on Friday that they chose to invoke the 25th Amendment, which says the House must adjourn each month without a session until January 10th.\n\nThe House is closed at the end of each month for the remainder of the fiscal year. But there is still a lot of time left in that calendar year – or maybe more. If there are budget votes and negotiations that have to be made at the same time, that could mean the session would not end until Jan. 15th.\n\nBut Boehner, Cantor and other Republicans have decided to use the 25th Amendment to put the House back to work again.\n\nFor the last year, the speaker has been threatening to turn Washington into a fortress and has said that he is unwilling to agree to budget votes on the last day in October, as opposed to the last day before the September debt ceiling deadline.\n\nThat has been met with protests from fiscal hawks across the aisle, who want the votes to be held when the fiscal cliff and government shutdown issues are still on the table.\n\nNow the House is being forced to start that first day of the new session from the House floor, instead of from the chamber, in the House chamber.\n\nWhile a shutdown would be disastrous for the nation, there is nothing that can stop the House of Representatives from going back to work. The GOP conference will have to try and find a way to continue the session without a member going home for a week or so.\n\nIn his speeches on Friday, Boehner and Cantor argued that closing the chamber for prayer would give the House a \"spirit of prayer\" that was not happening at the time.\n\nHowever, that spirit of prayer was on display from day one in the House.\n\nBut here's how I think the chamber would look if the prayers were there for the first day of a session, and then for the next few months:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has said that he will not pray before the House votes on a new debt ceiling. But he may not do so in next month's session. (Photo by Ron Sachs/TWP-TV via Getty Images)\n\nIf there were a prayer at day one of the chamber's first new session, which will be on the first day it is no longer closed, there might be some noise.\n\nThe first meeting of the house's new session is not scheduled until Oct. 22, four days after the first vote in the 113th Congress.\n\nBut on the second day, a prayer from Cantor would still be heard, as would a prayer from Boehner.\n\nOn the first day of a new session, Boehner said, he had told House members, \"I'm not praying for you.\"\n\nOf course, the prayers will happen, and the day will arrive when the chamber has to be closed again.\n\nThere is a chance that Speaker Boehner and the entire Congress could be re-elected, and Boehner may decide that to invoke the prayers at the end of their session is the only \"spirit\" he can muster.\n\nThen again, he is the Speaker of the House. He may be reluctant to violate the Constitution.\n\nBut if there is a prayer from the Speaker on opening day, there will be a prayer with him, and I do not believe he will take it as a break from prayers he normally prays on Sunday.", "length": 977, "ended": true}

{"id": 94, "text": "The first step is always the easiest. Get a few drinks and do something to ease any stress you're feeling. If you already have a little tolerance for caffeine, you'll find a quick fix like a couple of shots or some dark chocolate will help you wake up and get out the house. Once you feel ready to get out of bed, make your way to the local grocery store and ask your local dairy farmer if you can find some of that tasty, nutrient-dense milk. Make sure it's a quality milk, from cows you trust. You'll also want to check the nutritional information on the bottle. Look under the section called \"Dairy Information.\" You might see a few of these words in bold. These mean milk, whey, casein, caseinate, cholestyramine, lactose, lactoglyceride, calcium phosphate, and cholesterol. A good number of the nutrients have the potential to help you sleep soundly, but not all do, and they don't all make your body feel better.\n\nBe patient and don't be a quitter. You will find that a day or two after you drink your first glass, a pleasant, sleepy feeling will settle in. The next couple of years will be the biggest challenge. Keep drinking and try to stay healthy all the while.\n\nWhat should I look for when finding dairy milk? Check the ingredient list on the bottle, then look for the words \"protein powder,\" \"milk protein,\" \"low-fat lactose,\" and \"natural flavor.\" (I can't believe I said these things.) Many of these ingredients are actually sugar; lactose and/or caseinate are natural sweeteners that cause a pleasant feeling inside the mouth. Keep in mind that your taste buds have an incredible capacity to discern flavor, so don't worry about the nutrition as much as you do taste.\n\nHow do I consume dairy milk?\n\nAs you drink up your first glass, think of it as a cup of coffee or an eight ounce glass of diet soda. You would be consuming a small amount of protein from the milk and probably a little more from the whey and caseinate. However, these are nutrients that can be obtained elsewhere, like in the meat, fish, vegetables, and grains that you already eat.\n\nHere is an example of a recipe:\n\n1 2-ounce container of milk 1 package of whey and 1/2 bag of caseinate\n\n1/3 cup hot sauce or chili powder 2 tablespoons of ground turmeric 1 tablespoon fresh garlic\n\n2 teaspoons of fish sauce 1/3 cup of vegetable broth\n\n1/3 cup of water 1 tablespoon of lime juice ¼ cup of green tea powder 1/8 teaspoon of salt 1 tablespoon of cinnamon\n\nAdd all ingredients into a blender and pulse until smooth (this process might involve several blender blenders).\n\nHere is an example of a smoothie recipe:\n\n2 cups of almond flour 1 cup of soy milk 1 cup of soy milk powder 1 cup of water (I prefer non-dairy milk powder as it is more smooth) 8 raw almonds 1/2 cup of walnuts Instructions Add all ingredients into a blender and pulse until smooth. You can store this smoothie in an airtight container in the fridge. Or refrigerate in the morning when you wake up. This smoothie also makes for a great nightcap.\n\nWant to learn more about drinking dairy milk and other healthy choices?\n\nDo you know of any other great ways to improve your digestive function, lose weight, and sleep better?

{"id": 95, "text": "In recent weeks, the United States has been consumed by a controversy over how to protect its citizens from an unknown, homegrown threat.\n\nThe latest reports on the plot point to several months ago, but the administration has resisted calls to provide details of how this came to be—some of the best sources say it is likely a homegrown, Pakistani-born man who has no known ties to militant groups.\n\nThe U.S. has also dismissed calls from U.S. military officials to establish a \"kill list\" or set time limits on drone attacks on suspected Islamic extremist targets.\n\nOn Sunday, on a day of high emotions following the shooting at the Navy Yard massacre in Washington and the killing of an Italian man by a U.S. border patrol, President Obama said he had ordered new steps \"to ensure that we are doing everything that we can to defeat terrorism and keep our own citizens safe.\"\n\nBut the White House has not released the details of the president's \"new strategy\" or detailed new policy proposals to counter terror threats from terror groups such as al Qaeda and the more recent Islamic State.\n\n\nAnd in the meantime, the administration continues to resist calls to make such sweeping changes in U.S. counterterrorism policies, something Obama has been clear about. When asked by The New York Times Sunday about his administration's long-standing \"kill lists\" of extremists, Obama said, \"there's no doubt that there are individuals who are plotting to kill Americans and who were killed in the past.\"\n\n\"If we can't prevent people from killing Americans, then we're going to have to do more work to make sure that Americans have a higher level of confidence in their government and a higher level of security,\" Obama said.\n\nThe U.S. government has a long history of ignoring the threat posed by Uyghurs, an ethnic minority group in northwestern China. When Chinese dissidents attempted to overthrow the regime of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, Uyghurs in what was then the Xinjiang region were among the many who were targeted. While the Uyghur population is predominantly Muslim, the government has always tried to lump Uyghurs together under a single label—Chinese—in its claims of repression.\n\nThe Obama administration took pains over the years to maintain a low profile regarding the Uyghurs. However, on Saturday, Chinese authorities detained two Uyghur activists.\n\nIn an internal government email obtained by Reuters on Saturday, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region police chief, Dargei, said that one of the two was a \"high-profile criminal\" and would be detained for \"investigation\" while the other was a \"dissident\" and would not be apprehended.\n\nDargei said that the police chief in Birekeli, an Islamic-majority town, suspected the activists were planning a \"huge terrorist incident,\" and the two were detained for \"public disorder and criminal violations.\" Dargei added that he has ordered his officers to work with the Uyghurs \"to ensure safety of Uyghur civilians,\" and accused the activists of being \"agents for foreign powers.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration was forced to step up its criticism Monday of Pakistan following the publication in Foreign Policy magazine of a damning report by three Pakistani political analysts who said the U.S. embassy in Islamabad has become the \"Saudi Arabia of Pakistan.\"\n\n\nThe analysts, who said that U.S. and Pakistani officials have been \"concealing\" facts about militant links with al Qaeda by failing to share information, said U.S. officials in Islamabad repeatedly threatened Pakistani journalists in 2010 and 2011 with drone strikes.\n\nPresident Obama was asked in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday what he plans to do to thwart al Qaeda attacks on the West. As the top U.S. executive, Obama said, he would make it clear to Pakistan, \"That the United States will not tolerate terrorist safe havens in Pakistani territory.\"\n\n\nThe U.S. government is also concerned about the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, which has declared a caliphate from northern Iraq, through Syria and Iraq's western region.\n\n\n\"ISIS is a threat to the world and to the United States, as well as to global security…ISIS seeks to overthrow what the United States refers to as the Islamic State. I have stated quite plainly that is an objective that we will not tolerate—either now or in the future,\" Obama said, acknowledging that while America has a right to protect its citizens from foreign threats, it should protect itself \"from those who want to harm us.\"\n\n\"We have to keep up our vigilance, keep our vigilance,\" Obama said.", "length": 982, "ended": true}

They fell from 434 MPs in 2000 to 398 in 2008, 462 in 2010 and 454 in 2013.\n\nThe study also found that the number of people in Parliament who are Conservative party members (currently 498-499) has fallen by almost two per cent since 2008. The drop came from the total number of people who identify as conservatives, the study found.\n\nWhile the number of Conservative members has fallen, it still represents more than three per cent of every new MP and more than four per cent of every new Commons member.

{"id": 99, "text": "The next time you need a new smartphone, think twice about a competing device. Many Android-powered smartphones today feature cutting edge processors, high-quality cameras, and plenty of free apps, while many iPhones continue to look a long time ago when Google released its most advanced smartphone in years.\n\nIn fact, some of the most popular Android handsets — like Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel — are older devices that have been outfitted with new processors, cameras, and more useful apps. Apple's iOS continues to feature top-shelf hardware and powerful features, while most Android phones come with an impressive lineup of features, software, and apps that simply won't work with current-gen devices.\n\nThat said, there are some new smartphones that are set to offer features that, while not quite on par with those of the last-generation, have the potential to be top-of-the-line in terms of performance. We've already seen and written about several of these smartphones, including Huawei Mate 8, Apple iPhone X, and Google Huawei Nexus lineup.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 with a 5.8-inch Full HD Display\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 isn't Apple's iPhone X in terms of resolution, though it is an iPhone 8 nonetheless. The S8 and iPhone X use next-generation Infinity Display technology, while the S8 and iPhone 8 Plus both have an edge-to-edge display that measures 6 inches. Even though the two devices are about the same size, in terms of visual impact, the display of the S8 is nearly two inches clearer and nearly four inches thicker.\n\nThe Infinity Display and an all-metal body both give the Galaxy S8 and other Android phones an even more premium feel, while also giving it sharper colors and a sharper image. The fingerprint scanner that sits on the bottom of these phones is another standout feature on these devices, but there's no need to sacrifice the convenience of a physical keyboard if you're not trying to do some serious work.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 with curved edges and 5.8-inch Full HD Display\n\nIf you're looking to purchase a mid-range Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8 Plus, we recommend picking one up from AT&T now rather than waiting for the iPhone X. The Galaxy S8 is arguably a stronger contender for high-performance users, both by its hardware specs and the fact that it takes advantage of Samsung's software enhancements. For instance, you can now launch the S8 via voice using its newly integrated Assistant.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 Plus with a 5.8-inch Full HD Display\n\nThe Galaxy S8 Plus — and other S8 devices — will come to AT&T first, and you can pre-order one beginning on September 30. All the same, AT&T is the only carrier to offer the phone with the 5.8-inch screen — which also allows for it to be placed to one side, unlike many other devices that allow you to place it at an angle.

{"id": 100, "text": "\"A woman who believes in the right of every American to choose abortion,\" he says, \"will work to ensure that no other American is denied the right to choose it for her.\" The senator has not, indeed, endorsed Romney's candidacy, he says. But he has given a speech on the issue, and in 2009 he voted for a federal ban on late-term abortions, which President Obama supported. \"In this day and age, there are more and more women who want to choose their own destiny and I believe that life begins at conception, so I am voting to protect Roe v. Wade,\" he said last month. The abortion issue may appear to have died down, but it isn't gone: In the past five years, the number of House votes supporting abortion rights has nearly tripled, to more than 1,500. (That's one more than for the rest of last year and four more than in 2008.) And the number of legislators and legislators-elect who say they favor the bill is increasing. In an opinion piece published in the Washington Post, Linda Greenhouse called the passage of the Hyde Amendment \"the most significant event in the American abortion debate since Roe v. Wade was decided 50 years ago.\"\n\nEven more remarkable, in recent years, some of the highest-profile pro-choice activists are actually pro-choice candidates themselves. In 2000, when New Hampshire became the first state to pass a bill banning abortions following 12 weeks, Jane Harman, the state's junior senator, was one of the first to break with the Republican Party and support it on her part. Now, she's considered the Democratic successor to Hillary Clinton, and Obama has said she's \"wonderful\" as his running mate, and her current candidacy is considered a major factor in Obama's decision. In 2011, the pro-choice campaign group NARAL Pro-Choice America began to run TV ads in California urging Democrats to vote against the abortion ban. \"What's going to really work is electing Democrats who believe that abortion is a moral issue, and think we shouldn't be legislating it,\" the ad narrator says. \"It shouldn't be one of those things that ends up in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nSo what's this Hyde Amendment amendment all about? It's an amendment to the Constitution, enacted in 1976 to restrict the use of federal funds to pay for abortions, to ensure that funds never go toward funding for a procedure that is morally questionable. While the Republican-controlled House and Senate in the Seventies removed all federal funds for abortion, the Supreme Court's decision in Casey (2000), in which it overturned Casey, did not. Now, abortion is banned on federal funds, and it's the Hyde Amendment that prohibits federal funds from paying for certain kinds of abortions, including those \"for the termination of pregnancy when the fetal life of the mother would be endangered unless the child is born alive.\" There is precedent, though, for Hyde Amendment bans, which go back to 1920, when Congress passed a law that prevented the use of federal funds for abortions even if performed in cases of rape. The Hyde Amendment has survived even when the party opposing the bill has won reelection, which has been true five times since 1984.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, which was passed with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate, was enacted at the height of the anti-abortion movement. In 1970, it was introduced in the House by Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., to ban the abortion of women who had been raped by a husband or boyfriend, even if the rape occurred when the woman was under the age of 18. The proposal was defeated in committee that year, and it never received a vote in the House of Representatives. Walsh then proposed the amendment at a national conference about abortion in Washington, D.C., in 1972, according to an article on the Hyde Amendment by Joan Tarshis in the Chicago Tribune, and was quickly adopted. \"It seems more appropriate now than it did a generation ago to consider alternatives,\" Walsh told delegates. \"For example, the possibility of obtaining an abortion should not be a reason for the government to forbid abortion on principle.\" One of his fellow anti-abortion lawmakers was Rep. Henry Hyde, who was also at the conference, and he introduced the amendment.\n\nAbortion rights groups such as NARAL, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Planned Parenthood hailed the Hyde Amendment as a way to prevent women who were raped from obtaining abortions in a way that would be constitutionally problematic. \"There are always people who think, 'A woman could get a abortion under certain conditions,' \" says NARAL's Nancy Keenan, \"but Hyde was the bill that said if you committed rape, the only way you could get an abortion was with consent of the victim.\" NARAL helped to pass the ban, which Hyde's amendment was aimed at enforcing and keeping in place. (By 1987, the Hyde Amendment had expired. It was reauthorized and expanded in 1995.) \"It was a way", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
